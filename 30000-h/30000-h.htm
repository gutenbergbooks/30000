<h3>DIVING BIRDS. Order I. PYGOPODES</h3>

<h3>GREBES. Family COLYMBID&AElig;</h3>

<p>Grebes are birds having a ducklike body, but with pointed bills. Their
feet, too, are unlike those of the Ducks, each toe having its separate web, and
having a broad flat nail. Their wings are very small for the size of the body,
making it impossible for them to rise in flight from the land. They rise from
the water by running a few yards along the surface until they have secured
sufficient headway to allow them to launch themselves into the air. After
having risen from the water their flight is very swift and strong. On land they
are very awkward and can only progress by a series of awkward hops; they
generally lie flat on their breasts, but occasionally stand up, supporting themselves
upon their whole tarsus. Grebes, together with the Loons, are the most
expert aquatic birds that we have, diving like a flash and swimming for an incredible
distance under water.</p>

</div>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Western Grebe.</span> <i>Aechmophorus occidentalis</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--Western parts of North America, from
southern Alaska southward; east to Minnesota
and south in winter to the southern parts of the
United States and Mexico. Breeds from the Dakotas
and northern California northward. These
are the largest of the American Grebes; owing to
their unusually long necks, they are frequently
called "Swan Grebes." They are very timid
birds and conceal themselves in the rushes on
the least suspicion of danger.</p><div class="figleft" style="width: 410px"><img alt="" src="images/013b.png">
<p>Chalky bluish white, stained buff.</p>
</div><p>At times, to escape
observation, they will entirely submerge their
body, leaving only their head and part of the
long neck visible above the water. This Grebe
cannot be mistaken for any other because of the
long slender neck and the long pointed bill,
which has a slight upward turn. They nest abundantly
in the marshes of North Dakota and central
Canada. Their nests are made of decayed rushes,
and are built over the water, being fastened to
the rushes so that the bottom of the nest rests in
the water. The nesting season is at its height
during the latter part of May. They lay from
three to five eggs, the ground color of which is a
pale blue; this color is, however, always concealed by a thin chalky deposit,

<p>Eared Grebes differ from the preceding in having
the entire neck blackish. They nest very
abundantly throughout the west, in favorable localities,
from Texas to Minnesota and Dakota.
Their nests are constructed in the same manner
as the preceding varieties and are located in similar localities.
As do all
the Grebes when leaving the nest, they cover the eggs with the damp rushes from
around the base of the nest. This is probably
for the purpose of assisting incubation
during their absence, by the action of
the sun's rays on the wet mass. As they
are nearly always thus covered upon the
approach of anyone, this may be done also
as a protection from discovery. They lay
from three to eight bluish white eggs with
the usual chalky and discolored appearance.
The breeding season is at its height
early in June, or earlier, in the southern
portion of its range. Size 1.75 &times; 1.20. Data.--Artesian,
S. Dakota, June 21, 1899. Nest
of rushes, floating in three feet of water.

of this family found in the same localities
during the summer. These little Grebes
nest very abundantly along the Rio Grande

from the latter part of May until well into
December.</p>

<p>Their nests are floating piles of grass and

<p>The Dabchick, as this bird is called, is the most evenly distributed bird
of this family. It is nowhere especially abundant, nor is it, except in a very
few localities, regarded as rare. Consequently it is the best known bird of
the species. They do not congregate in such large numbers as the other
Grebes during the nesting season, but one
or more pairs may be found in almost any
favorable locality. These birds render their
floating nest a little more substantial than
those of the preceding varieties by the addition
of mud which they bring up from the
bottom of the pond; this addition also tends
to soil the eggs more, consequently the
eggs of this bird are, as a general rule,
browner than the other Grebes with the exception
of the Least. The bird may always
be known by the shape of its bill which is
higher than it is broad, and in the summer
is white with a black band across the middle. The throat is also black at
this season. They lay from five to nine eggs commencing about the middle
of May. Size 1.70 &times; 1.18.</p>

<h3>LOONS. Family GAVIIDAE</h3>

<p>Loons may be likened to gigantic Grebes from which they differ externally,
chiefly in the full webbed foot instead of the individually webbed toes of
the Grebe, and in the sharper, more pointed and spear-like bill. These birds
are similar in their habits to the Grebes, except that their homes are generally
more substantially built and are placed upon a solid foundation, generally
upon an island in some inland lake.</p>

<p>Both Loons and Grebes are literally "Water witches," being practically,
and in the case of Grebes, actually, born in the water and living in it ever
afterwards. Loons are strong fliers, but like the Grebes, because of their
small wings they must get their first impetus from the water in order to
rise; in case there is any wind blowing they also make use of this by starting
their flight against it. They are very peculiar birds and the expression
"crazy as a loon" is not a fanciful one, being formed from their early morning
and evening antics when two or more of them will race over the top of the
water, up and down the lake, all the while uttering their demoniacal laughter.
They vie with the Grebes in diving and disappear at the flash of a gun.</p>

<p>Loon.<br>Black-throated Loon.</p></div>

<p>7. <span class="sc">Loon.</span> <i>Gavia immer.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America north of the Mexican
boundary, breeding from the northern
parts of the United States northward.</p>

<p>Unlike the Grebes, Loons do not build in
colonies, generally not more than one, or
at the most two pairs nesting on the same
lake or pond; neither do they seek the
marshy sloughs in which Grebes dwell, preferring
the more open, clear bodies of
water. The common Loon may be known
in summer by the entirely black head and
neck with the complete ribbon of black and
white stripes encircling the lower neck and
the narrower one which crosses the throat.
The back is spotted with white. In some
sections Loons build no nest, simply scooping
a hollow out in the sand, while in other
places they construct quite a large nest of
sticks, moss and grasses. It is usually placed
but a few feet from the waters edge, so
that at the least suspicion the bird can slide
off its eggs into the water, where it can cope
with any enemy. The nests are nearly always
concealed under the overhanging
bushes that line the shore; the one shown
in the full page illustration, however, was
located upon the top of an old muskrat
house. The two eggs which they lay are a
very dark greenish brown in color, with
black spots. Size 3.50 &times; 2.25. Data.--Lake
Sunapee, N. H., June 28, 1895. Nest placed
under the bushes at the waters edge. Made
of rushes, weeds and grasses; a large structure
nearly three feet in diameter. Collector,
H. A. Collins.</p>

<p>8. <span class="sc">Yellow-billed Loon.</span> <i>Gavia adamsi.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Northwestern North America, along the Arctic and northern Alaskan
coasts.</p>

<p>The Yellow-billed Loon with the exception of its whitish or yellowish bill
in place of the black, is practically otherwise indistinguishable from the
common Loon. It averages somewhat larger in size. This is one of the most
northerly breeding birds and it is only within a very few years that anything
has been learned about the breeding habits. Their nesting habits and eggs
are precisely like the preceding except that the latter average a little larger.
Size 3.60 &times; 2.25.</p>

<p>9. <span class="sc">Black-throated Loon.</span> <i>Gavia arctica.</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--From northern United States northward, breeding along the Arctic
Coast.</p>

<p>This species can be easily separated from the Loon by the gray crown and
white streaks down the back of the neck. Its size, too, is about five inches
shorter. The nesting habits are the same as the Loons and the eggs have
rather more of an olive tint besides having the majority of spots at the
larger end. Size 3.10 &times; 2.00.</p>

<p>This is the smallest of the Loon family, being
twenty-five inches in length. In plumage it is
wholly unlike any of the other members at all

and neck are gray, the latter being striped with
white. A large chestnut patch adorns the front
of the lower part of the neck. In winter the

<p>Puffins, Auks and Murres are all sea birds and are only found inland when
blown there by some severe storm of winter. At this season numbers of them
are apt to lose their bearings and may sometimes be found with their feet
frozen in some of our inland ponds. Puffins are heavily built birds in appearance,
but are very active both on the wing and in the water. Their wings are
much larger comparatively than those of the other members of this family,
so they are enabled to perform evolutions in the air, which are withheld from
the others. They stand upright on the sole of the foot and are able to walk
quite easily on land. Puffins have very heavy and deep but thin bills, which
are entirely unlike those of any other bird and often give then the name of
Parrot Auks. Puffins, Auks and Murres are otherwise recognized by the presence
of but three toes which are webbed.</p>

<p>Tufted Puffins are the largest of the Puffins.
In the breeding plumage, they are a sooty brownish
or black color; the cheeks are white, and a
long tuft of straw colored feathers extends back
from each eye; the bill is bright red and greenish
yellow. They breed commonly on the Farallones,
where two or three broods are raised by a
bird in a single season, but much more abundantly
on the islands in the north.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 420px"><img alt=""

<p>White.</p></div>


<p>Their single eggs are laid in burrows in the ground or else in
natural crevices formed by the rocks. The eggs are pure white or pale buff
and are without gloss. They very often have barely perceptible shell markings
of dull purplish color. The eggs are laid about the middle of June. Size 2.80

Collector, W. O. Emerson.</p>

<p>13. <span class="sc">Puffin.</span> <i>Fratercula arctica arctica.</i></p>

<p>White..</p></div>
<p>The common Puffin has the cheeks, chin and underparts white; upper parts
and a band across the throat, blackish. Bill deep and thin, and colored with
red, orange and yellow. They breed in large numbers on Bird Rock in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The nest is either among the natural crevices of the
rocks, or in burrows excavated
in the ground by the birds.
These burrows vary in length
from two and a half to four
or five feet. Except upon the
positive knowledge of the absence
of the bird, it is a
hazardous thing to put the
hand in one of these burrows
for the bird can, and will nip
the fingers, sometimes to the
bone. They lay but a single
egg, usually dull white and
unmarked, but in some cases
obscurely marked with reddish
brown. Size 2.50 &times; 1.75. Data.--So. Labrador, June 23, 1884. Single egg

</p>

<p>13a. <span class="sc">Large-billed Puffin.</span> <i>Fratercula arctica naumanni.</i></p>

<p>A more northerly subspecies of the last, inhabiting the Arctic region on the

<p>14. <span class="sc">Horned Puffin.</span> <i>Fratercula corniculata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to British Columbia. The Horned Puffin
differs from the common in that the blackish band across the throat extends
upwards in a point to the bill. Their nesting habits are precisely the same as
those of the preceding species. A single pure white egg is laid; the shell is
slightly rougher than those of the others. Size 2.65 &times; 1.80. Data.--Round Is.,

Collector, G. L. Kennedy.</p>

<p>15. <span class="sc">Rhinoceros Auklet.</span> <i>Cerorhinca monocerata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from British Columbia northward and wintering
southward to Lower California.</p>

<p>The Rhinoceros Auklet or Horned Auk has a much smaller bill than the
Puffins; in the summer this is adorned at the base by a horn from which it
takes its name. There are also slender plumes from above and below the eyes.
Unlike the Puffins, these birds sit upon their whole tarsus.</p>

<p>They nest on islands of the North Pacific Coast from Vancouver northward.
A single egg is laid in crevices among the rocks or in burrows in the ground.
It is similar both in size and shape to that of the Puffins, but is often quite
heavily blotched with brown. Size 2.70 &times; 1.80. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska, June

<p>Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to Lower
California, breeding nearly throughout its range.</p>

<p>A plain appearing bird about 9 in. in length,
with blackish upperparts relieved only by a white
spot over the eye; breast and throat gray and

<p>The late Mr. C. Barlow says that it
is found in deserted rabbit burrows and in all
probability often excavates its own burrows. It
also nests among the cliffs placing its eggs among
the rocks in any crevice or tunnel which may offer
a dark retreat during the day for they are nocturnal
in their habits. The single egg which they
lay is dull white in color, the inside of the shell
being a pale green, which color can only be seen
by holding the egg to the light. They are generally
slightly nest stained. Size 1.80 &times; 1.30.
Data.--Coronado Islands, Cal., March 23, 1897.
Single egg laid on the bare ground at end of a
burrow three and one-half feet long. Collector,
E. A. Shives.</p>

length 6.5 in. This species has no crest, but has
the slender white plumes extending back from
the eye. The entire under parts are white sparsely
spotted with dusky. This species is by far the
most abundant of the water birds of the extreme
Northwest, and thousands of them, accompanied
by the two preceding species, nest on the rocky

<p>The bird differs from the Black Guillemot
only in having the bases of the coverts white
also. The nesting habits and eggs are identical.
They nest in colonies of thousands and
place the eggs upon the bare rock with no attempt
at nest building. Generally the eggs
are in the crevices so as to be difficult to get

This bird is very similar to the Black
Guillemot except that the under surfaces of
the wings are dark. They breed abundantly on some of the islands of Bering
Sea and a few of them nest on the Farallones. They lay their two eggs on
the bare rock in dark crevices. The color is grayish or pale greenish blue
and the markings are brown and
black with paler shell markings of
lilac. Size 2.40 &times; 1.60. Data.--S.

in length. Entire head and neck
sooty brown; rest of upper parts</p>

Pale bluish gray.

<p>grayish black except the tips of
the secondaries which are white. Under parts white. These birds nest by
thousands on Bird Rock and on the cliffs of Labrador. They build no nests
but simply lay their single egg on the narrow ledges of cliffs, where the only
guarantee against its rolling off is its peculiar shape which causes it, when
moved, to revolve about its smaller end instead of rolling off the ledge. The
eggs are laid as closely as possible on the ledges where the incubating birds
sit upright, in long rows like an army on guard. As long as each bird succeeds
in finding an egg to cover, on its return home, it is doubtful if they
either know or care whether it is their own or not. The ground color of the
eggs vary from white to a deep greenish blue and the markings of blackish
brown vary in endless patterns, some eggs being almost wholly unspotted.

<p>This Pacific form of the common Murre is the most abundant breeding bird
on the Farallones. Their eggs are used in enormous numbers for commercial
purposes and these islands being located, as they are, within easy distance
from San Francisco, thousands of dozens of the eggs are sold yearly, chiefly
to bakeries. Although continually robbed, their numbers have not as yet
diminished to any great extent. They lay but a single egg on the bare ledge.
Individual eggs are indistinguishable from the last species but in a large
series the ground color averages brighter. They show the same great difference
in color and markings. The first set is laid in May, but owing to
their being so often molested, fresh eggs can be found during August. Data.--Farallones,

<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/033.png"><br>
Grayish white.</p>


<p>The Razor-billed Auk is in form similar to the Murres, but the bill is very
different, being deep and thin, and with the upper mandible rounded at the
tip. Entire upper parts black shading to brownish on the throat. Under parts
and tips of secondaries, white; line from eye to bill and another across the
middle of the bill, white. They nest in large numbers on Bird Rock in company
with the Murres and in still greater numbers off the coast of Labrador.
Their eggs are not placed in as exposed positions as the Murres, being generally
behind boulders or in crevices. This is necessary because, not being
of the pear-shaped form of the Murres, they would be very apt to be dislodged
if commonly placed on the narrow ledges. The eggs vary endlessly in marking
but do not show the differences in ground color that the Murres do. The
color is white, grayish or buffy. But one egg is generally laid, although two
are sometimes found. Size 3.00 &times; 2.00. Data.--Bay of Fundy. June 17, 1891.

<p>Great Auk Dovekie.</p></div>
<p>33. <span class="sc">Great Auk</span>. <i>Plautus impennis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Formerly the whole of the North Atlantic
coasts. Now extinct.</p>

<p>These great auks formerly dwelt in large numbers
on the islands of the North Atlantic, but
owing to their lack of the powers of flight and
the destructiveness of mankind, the living bird
has disappeared from the face of the earth.
Although they were about thirty inches in length,
their wings were even smaller than those of the
Razor-billed Auk, a bird only eighteen inches in
length. Although breeding off the coast of Newfoundland,
they appeared winters as far south as
Virginia, performing their migration by swimming
alone. The last bird appears to have been
taken in 1844, and Funk Island, off the coast of
Newfoundland, marks the place of their disappearance
from our shores. There are about seventy
known specimens of the bird preserved, and
about the same number of eggs. The immediate
cause of the extinction of these birds was their
destruction for food by fishermen and immigrants,
and later for the use of their feathers commercially.
The single egg that they laid was about 5.00 x 3.00
inches, the ground color was buffy white, and the spots brownish and blackish.
The markings varied in endless pattern as do those of the smaller Auk.
There are but two real eggs (plaster casts in imitation of the Auks eggs are
to be found in many collections) in collections in this country, one in the
Academy of Natural Science, Philadelphia, and the other in the National
Museum, at Washington. Through the kindness of Mr. Witmer Stone, of the
Academy of Natural Science, we are enabled to show a full-sized reproduction
from a photograph of the egg in their collection.</p>

<p>Skuas and J&aelig;gers are birds having a Gull or Tern-like form and with a hooked
bill, the base of which is covered with a scaly shield. They have webbed
feet and are able to swim and dive, but they commonly get their living by
preying upon the Gulls and Terns, overtaking them by their superior speed
and by their strength and ferocity forcing them to relinquish their food. The
J&aelig;gers especially are one of the swiftest and most graceful birds that fly.</p>

<p>The long-tailed J&aelig;ger is, according to length,
the largest of the J&aelig;gers, being 21 in. long; this is, however, due to the long
sharp pointed central pair of tail feathers, which extend about eight inches

even more graceful in flight than are
the Gulls and Terns, floating, skimming,
sailing, plunging, and darting
about with incredible swiftness and
ease. Like the others of this family,
they pilfer their food from the Gulls,
and are also very destructive to young
birds and eggs. Their eggs are either
laid on the bare ground or in a

<h2>GULLS and TERNS. Family LARID&AElig;</h2>
<br>
<p>Gulls are webbed footed birds having a slight hook to the end of the upper
mandible. Their plumage is generally a silvery gray above and white below.
They nest in large colonies, some on the islands of fresh water inland, but
mostly on the sea coast. They procure their food from the surface of the
water, it consisting mostly of dead fish and refuse matter, and crustacea which
they gather from the waters edge. When tired they rest upon the surface of
the water, where they ride the largest waves in perfect safety.</p>

<p>Terns are birds of similar plumage to the Gulls, but their forms are less robust
and the bills are generally longer and sharply pointed. Their food consists
chiefly of small fish which they secure by hovering above the water, and
then plunging upon them. They are less often seen on the surface of the
water than are the Gulls.</p>

the plumage is entirely white; the bill is tipped
with yellow and there is a red ring around
the eye. These Gulls nest in large colonies in
the Arctic Regions, placing their nests on the
high rocky cliffs. The nest is made of grass,
moss and rubbish, and the three eggs are laid

<p>The Kittiwake is sixteen inches in length, has
a pearly gray mantle, black tips to the primaries,
and remainder of plumage white. Its hind toe
is very small being apparently wanting in the
eastern form, while in the Pacific it is more developed.
These are very noisy Gulls, their notes

<p>This Kittiwake is similar to the preceding, with
the exception that the legs are bright red, the

species was found by Dr. Leonard Stejneger to be
a very abundant nesting bird on islands in Bering
Sea, selecting steep and inaccessible rocks and ledges on which to build
its nest. Their nesting habits are precisely the same as the Pacific Kittiwake,
but they most often nest in separate colonies, but can be distinguished readily
when nesting together by the darker mantles when on the nest and the red
legs when flying. Grass, moss and mud are used in the nest. The ground color
of the eggs is buffy or brownish, and the spots are dark brown and lilac.

the largest of the Gulls, being 28 inches in length. Mantle light gray; it is
distinguished by its size and the primaries, which are white to the tips. A
powerful bird that preys upon the smaller Gulls and also devours the young
and eggs of smaller birds.</p>

<p>They nest on the ground on the islands and shores of Hudson Bay, Greenland,

questioned and has not
yet been decided satisfactorily.
Early in June
their nests are built on
remote islands in Bering

<p>This Gull in appearance is precisely like the two preceding ones but is considerably
smaller; 24 inches in length. A very common bird in the north,
breeding in colonies of thousands on many of the islands. It is regarded as
one of the most common
of the larger Gulls in Bering

commonly in Hudson Bay
and Greenland, as well as
in the Eastern Hemisphere.
They nest indifferently
on high rocky cliffs or
on low sandy islands. Except
when the eggs are laid
in a sandy depression in
the soil, quite bulky nests
are made of seaweed and
moss. The eggs are laid
about the first of June;
they number two to three
and have a ground color
of brownish or greenish brown and are blotched with umber. Size 2.80 &times; 1.83.

on the cliffs, a large nest of seaweed is made,
whereas if they are on the ground, especially in
sandy places no attempt is made at nest-building. The eggs have a greenish
brown ground color and dark brown spots. Size 2.75 &times; 2.05. Data.--West Coast
of Vancouver Island. June 20, 1896. Three eggs; nest made of seaweed.
Located on a low ledge. Collector, Dr. Newcombe.</p>

<p>45. <span class="sc">Kumlien's Gull</span>. <i>Larus Kumlieni</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--North Atlantic coast, breeding in Cumberland Sound and wintering
as far south as Long Island.</p>

<p>This bird differs from the Glaucous-winged only in the pattern of the gray
markings of the primaries and in having a little lighter mantle. It is quite
common in its breeding haunts where it places its nest high up on the ledges
of the cliffs. The eggs are not different apparently from glaucescens.</p>

<p>46. <span class="sc">Nelson's Gull</span>. <i>Larus nelsoni</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--Coast of Alaska.</p>

<p>Plumage exactly like that of Kumlien Gull and questionably a new species.
The nests and eggs are not to be distinguished from the preceding.</p>

<p>The largest of the Gulls (thirty inches long)
and unlike any other. The mantle is dark slaty
black, and the primaries are black with white
tips. The bill is very large and powerful and
quite strongly hooked. They are quite abundant
birds in their range, and are very quarrelsome,
both among themselves and other species. They
do not breed in as large colonies as do the other
Gulls, half a dozen pairs appropriating a small
island to the exclusion of all other birds. They
are very rapacious birds and live to a great extent,
especially during the breeding season, upon the eggs and young of other
birds such as Ducks, Murres and smaller Gulls. They place their nests upon
the higher portions of sandy islands. They are made of grasses and seaweed.
The three eggs are laid early in June; they are grayish or brownish, spotted
with brown and lilac. Size 3.00 &times; 2.15. Data.--South Labrador, June 21, 1884.
Three eggs. Nest on a small island off the coast; of grasses and moss.</p>

<p>48. <span class="sc">Slaty-backed Gull</span>.--<i>Larus schistisagus</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--North Pacific and Arctic Oceans.</p>

<p>This Gull, which is similar to the Great Black-backed, but is smaller and has
a lighter mantle, does not breed in any considerable numbers on the American
side of the Pacific. It nests in June on some of the islands in Bering Sea
and probably more commonly farther north. They often nest in company with
other species, placing their small mounds of seaweed on the ground on the
higher parts of the islands. The full set contains three eggs of grayish or
brownish color, spotted with dark brown or black. Size 2.90 &times; 2.00. Data.--Harrowby
Bay, N. W. T. Canada, June 11, 1901. Nest of grass, roots and mud and
lined with dry grass; on point making into the bay. Collector, Capt. H. H.

<p>49. <span class="sc">Western Gull.</span> <i>Larus occidentalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from southern
California to British Columbia.</p>

<p>This bird, which is the most southerly distributed
of the larger Gulls is twenty-four inches in
length. Mantle slate colored; primaries black,
both these and the secondaries being broadly
tipped with white. These Gulls nest abundantly
on the Farallones, the majority of them showing
a preference for the lower portions of the island,
although they nest on the ledges also. Besides
man, these Gulls are the greatest enemies that
the Murres have to content against. They are
always on the watch and if a Murre leaves its
nest, one of the Gulls is nearly always ready to
pounce upon the egg and carry it away bodily in
his bill. The Gulls too suffer when the eggers
come, for their eggs are gathered up with the
Murres for the markets. They make their nests
of weeds and grass, and during May and June
lay three eggs showing the usual variations of
color common to the Gulls eggs. Size 2.75 &times; 1.90.</p>

<p>50. <span class="sc">Siberian Gull.</span> <i>Larus affinis.</i></p>

<p>This bird does not nest in North America, and
has a place on our list, by its accidental occurrence
in Greenland. It is an Old World species
and its nesting habits and eggs are like those of
the Herring Gull.</p>

<p>51. <span class="sc">Herring Gull.</span> <i>Larus argentatus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Whole of the Northern Hemisphere,

and wintering south to the Gulf.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px"><img alt=""

<p>Buff.</p></div>

<p>This Gull, which formerly was No. 51a, a subspecies
of the European variety, is now regarded
as identical with it, and is no longer a sub-species.
It is twenty-four inches in length, has a light gray mantle and black primaries
which are tipped with
white. The Herring
Gulls nest in colonies
in favorable localities
throughout their range,
chiefly on the coasts
and islands. A few pairs
also nest on islands in
some of the inland
bodies of fresh water.
Except in places where
they are continually
molested, when they
will build in trees, they
place their nests on the
ground either making
no nest on the bare
sand, or building a
bulky nest of seaweed
in the grass on higher
parts of the island.
They lay three eggs of
a grayish color marked with brown. In rare cases unspotted bluish white
eggs are found. Size 2.80 &times; 1.70.</p>

<p>A smaller Gull than the Herring with the primaries
grayish instead of black; length twenty-five inches. This Gull is found
in winter on the coast from British Columbia southward to Lower California,
but nests in the interior from Utah northward. They nest very abundantly
around the Great Salt Lake, placing their nests generally upon the bare ground.
Sometimes there is a scant lining of grasses or weeds and again the nests will
be situated in the midst of a tussock of grass. Three or four eggs generally
constitute a set, but occasionally five are laid. The usual nesting time is during
May. They show the same great variations in color and markings common
to most of the Gulls. Size 2.60 &times; 1.80.</p>

<p>A small Gull, eighteen inches in length, with a light gray mantle, black
primaries with white tips, and always to be distinguished in the breeding season
by the black band around the middle of the greenish yellow bill. They
nest in enormous colonies on islands in the interior of the country and in
smaller colonies on the coasts. Thousands of them breed on the lakes of the
Dakotas and northward. The majority of them nest on the ground, although
on the coast they are often found on the cliffs. They commonly lay three eggs
placing them in a slight hollow in the ground, generally on the grassy portions
of the islands. The color varies from grayish to brownish, marked with
brown and lilac. The height of the nesting season is in June. Size of eggs,

and then again only a few
pairs will be found on an
island. In Texas, the breeding
season commences in
May, it being later in the
more northern breeding
grounds. They may be regarded
as largely eastern
birds, as while they are common
in the interior of the
country, they are rarely found
on the Pacific Coast. Two or
three eggs constitute a complete
set; these are laid on
the sand in a slight hollow scooped out by the birds. They vary from gray to
greenish buff, marked with brown and lilac. Size 2.60 &times; 1.75. Data.--Hat Island,
Lake Michigan, July 1, 1896. No nest. Two eggs in a hollow in the
gravel. Fully a thousand terns nesting on about one acre. Collector, Charles
L. Cass.</p>

approached, all the birds arise like a great white
cloud, uttering their harsh, discordant "tearrr,
tearrr," while now and then an individual, bolder
than the rest, will swoop close by with an angry
"crack." On the whole they are timid birds, keeping
well out of reach. The nesting season is

<h2>SKIMMERS. Family RYNCHOPID&AElig;</h2>

<p>Skimmers are Tern-like birds having a very strangely developed bill. The
lower mandible is much longer than the upper and very thin, the upper edge
being as sharp as the lower. The lower mandible is rounded at the end while
the upper is more pointed. Young Skimmers are said to have both mandibles
of the same length, the abnormal development not appearing until after flight.
Skimmers are very graceful birds, and, as implied by their name, they skim
over the surface of the water, rising and falling with the waves, and are said
to pick up their food by dropping the lower mandible below the surface, its thin
edge cutting the water like a knife. There are four species of Skimmers, only
one of which is found in North America.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px"><img alt=""

<p>Buffy yellow.</p></div>

<p>Range.--The South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, breeding from New Jersey
southward. The Black Skimmer is about eighteen inches in length, and besides
the remarkable bill is a bird of striking plumage; the forehead, ends of
the secondaries, tail feathers and under parts are white; the rest of the plumage
is black and the basal half of the bill is crimson. Skimmers nest in large
communities, the same as do the Terns, laying their eggs in hollows in the
sand. They are partially nocturnal in their
habits and their hoarse barking cries may
be heard after the shadows of night have
enveloped the earth. Fishermen call them
by the names of "Cut-water" and "Sea Dog."
The nesting season commences in May and
continues through June and July. They lay
from three to five eggs, having a creamy
or yellowish buff ground, blotched with
black, chestnut and lilac. Size 1.75 &times; 1.30.
Data.--Cobb's Is., Va., June 8, 1894. Three

<p>Black-footed Albatross.<br>
Short-tailed Albatross.</p></div>
<p>Albatrosses are the largest of the sea birds and have an enormous expanse
of wing, the Wandering Albatross, the largest of the family, sometimes attaining
an expanse of fourteen feet. Their nostrils consist of two slightly projecting
tubes, one on each side near the base of the bill. They are unsurpassed
in powers of flight, but are only fair swimmers and rarely, if ever, dive, getting
their food, which consists of dead animal matter, from the surface of the water.</p>

<p>81. <span class="sc">Black-footed Albatross.</span> <i>Diomedea nigripes.</i></p>



<p>Range.--North Pacific from California northward.
This Albatross is thirty-two inches in
length; it is of a uniform sooty brown color shading
into whitish at the base of the bill, which is
rounded. Like the other members of the family,
this species is noted for its extended flights, following
vessels day after day without any apparent
period of rest, for the purpose of feeding on the
refuse that is thrown overboard. They breed
during our winter on some of the small isolated
islands in the extreme southern portions of the
globe. They lay a single white egg on the bare
ground.</p>

<p>82. <span class="sc">Short-tailed Albatross.</span> <i>Diomedea albatrus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North Pacific Ocean in summer, from
Lower California to Alaska. With the exception
of the Wandering Albatross, which is now regarded
as doubtful as occurring off our coasts, the
Short-tailed Albatross is one of the largest of
the group, measuring thirty-six inches in length,
and has an extent of seven feet or more. With
the exception of the black primaries, shoulders
and tail, the entire plumage is white, tinged with
straw color on the back of the head. They breed
on the guano islands in the North Pacific off the
coasts of Alaska and Japan. They lay a single
white egg on the bare ground or rocks. As with
the other members of the family, the eggs are
extremely variable in size, but average about
4.25 &times; 2.50.</p>

<p>Laysan Albatross.<br>
Yellow-nosed Albatross.<br>
Sooty Albatross.</p></div>
<p>Range.--Laysan Island of the Hawaiian Group,
appearing casually off the coast of California.
This species breeds in large numbers on the island
from which it takes its name. The birds are
white with the exception of the back, wings and
tail, which are black. The birds, having been little
molested in their remote island, are exceedingly
tame, and it is possible to go among the sitting
birds without disturbing them. Mr. Walter K.
Fisher has contributed an admirable report on
this species in the 1913 Bulletin of the Fish Commission,
the report being illustrated with numerous
illustrations of the birds from photos by the
author. Their single white eggs are laid on the
bare ground.</p>

<p>83. <span class="sc">Yellow-nosed Albatross.</span> <i>Thalassogeron culminatus.</i></p>

<p>This is a species which inhabits the South Pacific
and Indian Oceans, and is said to rarely occur
on the California coast. They breed during
our winter on some of the small islands and during
our summer are ocean wanderers. An egg in
the collection of Col. John E. Thayer was taken on
Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean; Sept. 1st,
1888. The nest was a mound of mud and grass
about two feet in height. The single white egg
measured 3.75 &times; 2.25. It was collected by George
Comer.</p>

<p>84. <span class="sc">Sooty Albatross.</span> <i>Phoebetria-palpebrata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Southern seas, north in our summer along the Pacific coast of the
United States.</p>

<p>This species is entirely sooty brown except the white eyelids. It is similar
to the Black-footed Albatross from which species it can be distinguished in
all plumages by the narrow base of the bill, while the bill of the former species
is broad and rounded. They breed commonly on isolated islands in many
quarters of the southern hemisphere. Sometimes this species constructs a
mound of mud on which to deposit its single white egg, and also often lays
it on the bare ground or rock. A specimen in Mr. Thayer's collection, taken
by Geo. Comer on So. Georgia Is. in the South Atlantic ocean, was laid in a
hollow among loose stones on the ledge of an overhanging cliff. Size 4.10 &times;
2.75.</p>

<h2>FULMARS, SHEARWATERS and PETRELS</h2>
<h3>Family PROCELLARIDAE</h3>

<p>Fulmars, Shearwaters and Petrels are Gull-like birds with two nostril tubes
located side by side, in a single tube, on the top of the bill at its base.</p>

<p>The Fulmars are mostly northern birds while the majority of the Shearwaters
nest in the extreme south during our winter, and appear off our coasts
during the summer. Their food consists of fish or offal which they get from
the surface of the water; large flocks of them hover about fishermen, watching
their chance to get any food which falls, or is thrown, overboard.</p>

<p>Range.--This Petrel is a native of the southern
seas and is only casually met with off the
Pacific coast.</p>

<p>It is the largest of the family, being about
three feet in length, and is normally a uniform
sooty color, although it has light phases of
plumage. They nest in December on many of
the islands south of Africa and South America,
laying their single white egg on the bare rocks.</p>

<p>86. <span class="sc">Fulmar.</span> <i>Fulmarus glacialis glacialis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North Atlantic coasts from New
England northward, breeding from Hudson
Bay and southern Greenland northward.</p>

<p>This bird which is 19 inches in length, in the light phase has a plumage
very similar to that of the larger Gulls. They nest by thousands on rocky
islands of the north, often in company with Murres and Gulls. Owing to the
filthy habits of the Fulmars, these breeding grounds always have a nauseating
odor, which is also imparted to, and retained by the egg shell. Their
single white eggs are laid on the bare rocks, in crevices of the cliffs, often
hundreds of feet above the water. Size 2.90 &times; 2.00. Data.--St. Kilda, off Scotland.
June 5, 1897. Single egg laid on rock on side of sea cliff. Collector, Angus
Gillies.</p>

<p>This sub-species of the preceding, has a darker
mantle than the common Fulmar; it is found on
the northern Pacific coasts where it breeds on
the high rocky cliffs, the same as its eastern
relative. They nest in large colonies, every
crevice in the rocks having its tenant. Their
flight is graceful like that of the Gulls, which
they closely resemble. They lay but a single
white egg, the average dimensions of which are
slightly smaller than those of the common Fulmar.
Data.--Copper Is., Alaska. May 14, 1889.

<p>86.1. <span class="sc">Rodger's Fulmar.</span> <i>Fulmarus rodgers.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North Pacific, breeding in large numbers
on some of the islands in Bering Sea; south
to California in winter. Very similar to the two
preceding species except that the back is mixed
with whitish, it is not believed to have a dark
phase. Their breeding habits and eggs do not
differ from the common Fulmar. The eggs are
laid on the rocky cliffs during June.</p>

<p>87. <span class="sc">Slender-billed Fulmar.</span> <i>Priocella glacialoides.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Southern seas, appearing on the Pacific coast of the United States
in the summer. This species has a paler mantle than the others of the family,
and the primaries are black. The make-up and plumage of the whole bird is
more like that of the Gulls than any of the others. They probably breed in
the far south during our winter, although we have no definite data relative
to their nesting habits.</p>

of our Shearwaters, and can be distinguished from
the next species by its wholly white underparts,
its light mantle and yellowish bill. We have no

<p>89. <span class="sc">Greater Shearwater.</span> <i>Puffinus gravis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--The whole of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Thousands of them spend the latter part of the
summer off the New England coast, where they
are known to the fishermen as Haglets. Their
upper parts are brownish gray, darker on the
wings; bill and feet dark; underparts white, with
the middle of the belly and the under tail covers
dusky. Length about 20 inches. Little is
known concerning their nesting quarters, although
they are said to breed in Greenland.

of the small islands and keys of the West Indies
and Bahamas, and not so commonly in the Bermudas.
Their eggs, which are pure white, are deposited
at the end of burrows dug by the birds.
Size of egg 2.00 &times; 1.35. Their nesting season commences
about the latter part of March and continues
through April and May. After the young
are able to fly, like other members of the family,
the birds become ocean wanderers and stray
north to southern New England. Data.--Bahamas,

called "Mother
Cary's Chicken" by the
sailors. They nest abundantly
on many of the islands
off the coasts of
Europe and the British
Isles, laying their single
egg either in burrows or crevices among the cliffs.
Data.--Coast of County Kerry, Ireland, June 1,
1895. Single egg laid at the end of burrow in a
sea cliff. Size 1.05 &times; .80; white with a wreath of
very fine dots about the larger end. Collector,
G. H. McDonald.</p>

<p>105. <span class="sc">Forked-tailed Petrel.</span> <i>Oceanodroma furcata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North Pacific from California to Alaska, breeding in the Aleutians.</p>

<p>These birds have a plumage of bluish gray, the wings being darker and the
underparts lightest. The nests are made in burrows or crevices in the banks.
Data.--Uniak Is., Alaska, June 10, 1900. No nest. Single egg laid at the
end of a burrow. Several pairs nesting near. Egg white with a fine wreath
of purplish black specks about the large end. Size 1.25 &times; .95.</p>

<p>105.2. <span class="sc">K&aelig;ding's Petrel.</span> <i>Oceanodroma k&aelig;dingi.</i></p>

<p>This bird is similar to Leach Petrel, but is
smaller and the tail is less deeply forked. Its
range is from California to Panama breeding
on the Revillagigedo Islands off Mexico.</p>

<p>106. <span class="sc">Leach's Petrel.</span> <i>Oceanodroma leucorhoa.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North Atlantic and North Pacific
Oceans, breeding from Maine and from the
Farallones, northward to Greenland and the Aleutians.</p>

<p>These are the most common of the Petrels
found on our coast; they are eight inches in
length, of a sooty brown color, and have a white
rump. The forked tail will at once distinguish
them from any of the Atlantic Petrels. They
nest in burrows in the ground, laying a pure
white egg, sometimes with a very faint dusty
wreath about the larger end. Size 1.20 &times; .95.
These birds generally take turns in the task of
incubation, one remaining at sea during the day
and returning at night while his mate takes her
turn roving the briny deep in search of food.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/071b.png">

<p>The young are fed by
regurgitation upon an oily
fluid which has a very offensive
odor. This odor
is always noticeable about
an island inhabited by
Petrels and is always retained
by the eggs or skins
of these birds. They are very rarely seen flying in the vicinity of their nesting
island during the day; the bird that is on the nest will remain until removed
by hand. Data.--Pumpkin Is., Maine, June 22, 1893. Single egg; nest
of a few grasses at the end of a burrow dug in the bank. Collector, J. Lefavour.</p>

Is. Their eggs are white very minutely wreathed
with reddish brown; they are, however, nearly always
nest stained to an uneven brownish color.
Data.--Guadalupe Is., Lower California, March 24,

can be distinguished from Leach Petrel by
its square tail and from the Stormy Petrel by its
large size and yellow webs to its feet. These

<h2>TOTIPALMATE SWIMMERS. Order IV. STEGANOPODES</h2>

<h3>TROPIC BIRDS. Family PHAETHONTIDAE</h3>

<p>Tropic Birds are Tern-like birds, having all the toes connected by a web,
and having the two central tail feathers very much lengthened.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/074a.png">
<p>Yellow-billed Tropic Bird.<br>
Red-billed Tropic Bird.</p></div>
<p>112. <span class="sc">Yellow-billed Tropic Bird.</span> <i>Ph&aelig;thon americanus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Tropical regions, breeding in the Bahamas,
West Indies and the Bermudas, casual in
Florida and along the South Atlantic coast.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px"><img alt="" src="images/074b.png">
<p>Dull purplish.</p></div>

<p>The Tropic Birds are the most strikingly
beautiful of all the sea birds; they are about 30
inches in length, of which their long slender tail
takes about 20 inches. They fly with the ease
and grace of a Tern, but with quicker wing beats.
They feed on small fish, which they capture by
darting down upon, and upon snails which they
get from the beach and ledges. They build their
nests in the crevices and along the ledges of the
rocky cliffs. While gregarious to a certain extent
they are not nearly as much so as the Terns.
The nest is made of a mass of seaweed and weeds;
but one egg is laid, this being of a creamy or pale
purplish ground color, dotted and sprinkled with
chestnut, so thickly as to often obscure the
ground color. Size 2.10 &times; 1.45. Data.--Coney Is.,
Bermudas, May 1, 1901. Nest made of moss and seaweed in a crevice on
ledge of cliff. Collector, A. H. Verrill.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px"><img alt="" src="images/075a.png">
<p>Pale purplish.</p></div>
<p>They breed on several islands in the Gulf of California. This species differs
from the preceding in having a red bill, and the back being barred with black.
Their plumage has a peculiar satiny appearance and is quite dazzling when
viewed in the sunlight. They
are strong fliers and are met
with, hundreds of miles from
land. They often rest upon the
water, elevating their long tails
to keep them from getting wet.
They nest, as do the preceding
species, on rocky islands and
are said to also build their nests
in trees or upon the ground.
The single egg that they lay
has a creamy ground and is minutely
dotted with chestnut.
Size 2.40 &times; 1.55. Data.--Daphone
Is., Galapagos Is., South Pacific, March 6, 1901. Egg laid in hole of a sea cliff.
The eggs are easily told from those of the yellow-billed by their much larger
size. Collector, R. H. Beck.</p>

<p>Range.--Tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, accidental off
the coast of Lower California.</p>

<p>This is a singularly beautiful species resembling the latter except that the
central tail feathers are bright red, with the extreme tips white. During
August and September they
breed in large colonies on
small islands in the South
Seas. On Mauritius Island
they build their nests either
in the trees or place them on
the ground; the nest is made
of seaweed, sticks and weeds;
numbers of them nest on
Laysan Is., of the Hawaiian
group, concealing their nests
on the ground under overhanging
brush.</p>

<p>The single egg has a pale
purplish ground speckled
with brown.</p>

<p>Gannets are large stoutly built birds, having the four toes joined by a web;
they have a small naked pouch beneath the bill; the bill is a little longer than
the head, and the tail is quite short. The plumage of the adults is generally
white, that of the young grayish.</p>

<p>114. <span class="sc">Blue-faced Booby.</span> <i>Sula syanops.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Widely distributed in the tropical seas,
north casually to Florida and breeding in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the Gannets, this one is stupid
and will often remain on the nest until removed
with the hand, merely hissing at the intruder.
Often they lay their eggs on the bare ground, but
sometimes the nest is lined with seaweed or grass.
They lay either one or two eggs early in April.
These eggs are of a dull white color and are heavily
covered with a chalky deposit. Size 2.50 &times; 1.70.
Data.--Clarion Is., Mexico, May 24, 1897. Nest

<p>The common Booby is an abundant bird on
some of the islands of the Bahamas and Bermudas;
it is commonly called the Brown Booby because
the upper parts are of a brownish gray.
These birds, as do the other Gannets, have great
powers of flight and without apparent effort dart
about with the speed of an arrow. They are
quite awkward upon their feet and are not very
proficient swimmers. They rarely rest upon the
water except when tired. Hundreds and sometimes
thousands of them breed in company, laying
their eggs upon the bare rocks. Sometimes
a few sticks or grasses will be placed about the
bird to prevent the eggs from rolling away. They
generally lay two eggs, chalky white and nest
stained. Size 2.40 &times; 1.60. Data.--Key West, Bahamas,
April 14, 1891. No nest; two eggs laid on
the bare rocks.</p>

<p>115.1. <span class="sc">Brewster's Booby.</span> <i>Sula brewsteri.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific coast from Lower California southward. This Gannet replaces
the common Booby on the Pacific coast. It nests abundantly on many
islands in the Gulf of California, and in company with the blue-footed variety,
on San Pedro Martir Island. They generally lay two eggs, placing them upon
the bare rocks and surrounding them with a ring of sticks and seaweed to keep
them in place. The eggs are chalky white and cannot be distinguished from
those of the other Boobies. Data.--San Benedicto Is., Lower California, May
18, 1897. Single egg laid on the sand amid a few blades of grass.</p>

<p>116. <span class="sc">Red-footed Booby.</span> <i>Sula piscator.</i></p>

<p>This is another species that is only occasionally taken on the Florida coast.
The habits of the birds and their nesting habits are the same as those of the
others of the family. Two chalky white eggs are laid. Data.--San Benedicto
Is., Lower California, May 18, 1897. Single egg. Nest a few twigs of rank
grass. Collector, A. W. Anthony.</p>

<p>These are the largest of the family, being 35
inches in length. They feed on fish which they
catch by diving upon, from the air. When flying
their neck is carried fully extended. They rest
on the water when tired, the numerous air cells
beneath the skin, causing them to sit high up in
the water and enabling them to weather the
severest storm in perfect safety. The only known
breeding place in America is Bird Rocks, where
they nest by thousands, placing their nests in
rows on the narrow ledges; the nests are made
of piles of seaweed, mud and stones. They lay
but one egg of dingy white color and covered with
a chalky deposit. On St. Kilda Island, off the
coast of Scotland, they breed by millions. They
are very tame and will frequently allow themselves
to be touched with the hand. It is said
that thousands of the young are killed by fishermen
every year and marketed in Edinburg and
other places. Data.--St. Kilda Island, Scotland,
June 18, 1896. Single egg laid on a large mass of

<p>Anhingas or Snake Birds are curiously formed creatures with a Heron-like
head and neck, and the body of a Cormorant. They live in colonies in inaccessible
swamps. Owing to their thin and light bodies, they are remarkable
swimmers, and pursue and catch fish
under water with ease. When alarmed
they have a habit of sinking their
body below water, leaving only their
head and neck visible, thereby having
the appearance of a water snake.
They also fly well and dive from their
perch into the water with the greatest
celerity.</p>

<p>They nest in colonies in the swamps,
placing their nests of sticks, leaves

water. They breed in April, laying
from three to five bluish eggs, covered with a chalky deposit. Size 2.25 &times; 1.35.
Data.--Gainesville, Florida, May 18, 1894. Nest in the top of a button-wood
tree, made of leaves and branches, overhanging the water. Collector, George
Graham.</p>

<h2>CORMORANTS. Family PHALACROCORACID&AElig;</h2>

<p>Cormorants have a more bulky body than do the Anhingas; their tail is
shorter and the bill strongly hooked at the tip. Cormorants are found in
nearly all quarters of the globe. They are very gregarious and most species
are maritime. They feed upon fish which they catch by pursuing under water.
Most of the Cormorants have green eyes.</p>

Double-crested Cormorant.</p></div>

<p>Range.--The Atlantic coast breeding from Maine
to Greenland.</p>

<p>The common Cormorant or Shag is one of the
largest of the race, having a length of 36 inches.</p>

<p>In breeding plumage, the black head and neck

<p>There is also a large white patch on the flanks.
They nest in colonies on the rocky shores of Newfoundland
and Labrador, placing their nests of
sticks and seaweed in rows along the high ledges,
where they sit, as one writer aptly expresses it,
like so many black bottles. A few pairs also nest
on some of the isolated rocky islets off the Maine
coast. During the latter part of May and during
June they lay generally four or five greenish
white, chalky looking eggs. Size 2.50 &times; 1.40. Data.--Black

<p>This is a slightly smaller bird than carbo, and in the nesting season the white
plumes of the latter are replaced by tufts of black and white feathers from
above each eye. On the coast they nest the same as carbo and in company with
them on rocky islands. In the interior they place their nests on the ground or
occasionally in low trees on islands in the lakes. They breed in large colonies,
making the nests of sticks and weeds and lay three or four eggs like those of
the common Cormorant but averaging shorter. Size 2.30 &times; 1.40. Data.--Stump

<p>This sub-species is a common breeding bird in the swamps and islands of the
Gulf coast and north to South Carolina and southern Illinois. The nests are
placed in the mangroves in some of the most impenetrable swamps and are
composed of twigs and lined with leaves or moss. They lay three or four chalky
bluish white eggs. Size 2.30 &times; 1.40. Data.--Bird Is., Lake Kissimee, Florida,

<p>Range.--Northwestern coast of North America, breeding in Alaska, and south
to the northern boundary of the United States, breeding both in the interior
and on the coast, in the former case generally on the ground or in low trees
on swampy islands and in the latter, on the rocky cliffs of the coasts and
islands. The nests are built in the same fashion as the other Cormorants, and
the three to five eggs are similar. Size 2.45 &times; 1.40.</p>

<p>120c. <span class="sc">Farallon Cormorant.</span> <i>Phalacrocorax auritus albociliatus.</i></p>

<p>In company with other species of Cormorants, these birds breed in large
numbers on the Farallones, placing their nests well up on the higher ridges and
rocks. They breed most abundantly during May. When nesting on the inland
islands, they place their nests in low bushes. Their nests and eggs are similar
to those of the other Cormorants. Size 2.40 &times; 1.50. Data.--Farallones, California.

<p>This species is found more abundantly on the Farallones
than is the Farallone Cormorant. Like the other
Cormorants breeding on these islands, these cling closely
to their nests, for fear of being robbed by the Gulls, that
are ever on the watch to steal either eggs or young.

habits from others of the family. That the Cormorants
are expert fishermen may be seen from the fact that the
Chinese tame and have them catch fish for them, placing
a ring around their neck to prevent their swallowing the
fish. Their nesting places are very filthy, being covered
with excrement and remains of fish that are strewn
around the nests. They breed in June laying three or
four eggs. Size 2.50 &times; 1.50.</p>

<h2>PELICANS. Family PELECANID&AElig;</h2>

<p>Pelicans are large, short legged, web footed (all four toes joined by a web)
birds, the most noticeable feature of which is the long bill with its enormous
pouch suspended from lower mandible. This pouch, while normally contracted,
is capable of being distended to hold several quarts. It is used as a scoop in
which to catch small fish. Their skin is filled with numerous air cells, making
them very light and buoyant.</p>

<p>125. <span class="sc">American White Pelican.</span> <i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchos.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Temperate North America, breeding in the interior, from Utah and
the Dakotas northward. These large birds, reaching a length of five feet, are
entirely white except for the black primaries. They get their food by approaching
a school of small fish and, suddenly dipping their head beneath the surface,
sometimes scoop up a large number of fish at a time; after allowing the
water to run out of the sides of the mouth, they proceed to swallow their catch.
They nest in large communities on islands in some of the inland lakes.</p>

<p>Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Shoal Lake, Manitoba, furnish breeding ground
for many thousands of Pelicans. They build their simple nests on the ground,
making them of sticks and weeds. They generally lay two eggs, but often
three or four. Size 3.45 &times; 2.30. Data.--Egg Island, Great Salt Lake, June 19,
1884. Two eggs. Nest a slight hollow in the ground, surrounded by a few
sticks. Collector, F. F. Leonard.</p>

<p>Man-O'-War Bird.
</p></div>

<p>Range.--Tropical seas, north regularly in America to the South Atlantic and
Gulf coasts, casually farther.</p>

<p>Man-o'-war Birds or "Frigates," as they are
often called, are remarkable birds in many respects.
In comparison with their weight they
have the largest expanse of wing of any known
bird. Weighing only about four pounds they have
an extent of from seven to eight feet, their wings
being extremely long and pointed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px"><img alt="" src="images/088b.png">
<p>White.</p></div>

<p>The length of
the bird is about 40 inches, of which the tail comprises
about 18 in., 10 inches of this being forked.
They have a large bright orange gular sac, a long,
hooked bill, and small slightly webbed feet. Their
powers of flight combine the strength of the
Albatrosses and the grace of the Terns. They
are very poor swimmers and do not dive, so are
forced to procure their food by preying upon the
Gulls and Cormorants, forcing them to drop their
fish, which the pirates catch before it reaches the
water. They also feed upon flying fish, catching
them in the air, whither they have been driven by
their enemies in their natural element. They nest in large colonies on some of
the Bahama Islands and on some of the small Florida Keys. Their nests are
small frail platforms of sticks and twigs and the single egg is laid in March
and April. It is white and has a smooth surface. Size 2.80 &times; 1.90. Data.--Key
Verde, Bahamas, March 6, 1889. Single egg. Nest a frail affair of sticks on a
cactus. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.</p>

<h2>Order V. ANSERES</h2>

<h3>DUCKS, GEESE AND SWANS. Family ANATIDAE</h3>

<p>The birds comprising this family are of greatly varying sizes, but all have
webbed feet, and generally the bill is broader than high, and is serrated on the
edges or provided with gutters to act as a strainer in assisting the birds to
gather their food.</p>

<p>129. <span class="sc">Merganser.</span> <i>Mergus americanus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America, breeding from the
northern border of the United States northward.</p>

<p>The three species of Mergansers are almost
exclusively fish eating birds. Therefore their flesh
is unpalatable and they are known as "Fish
Ducks."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px"><img alt="" src="images/089b.png">
<p>Brownish buff.</p></div>

<p>They are also sometimes called "Sawbills"
because of the teeth-like serration on both
the upper and the under mandibles. Unlike the
other species of ducks, their bills are long, slender
and rounded instead of being broad and flat;
it is also hooked at the tip. Like the Cormorants,
they often pursue and catch fish under the water,
their teeth-like bills enabling them to firmly hold
their prey.</p>

<p>The American Mergansers, Goosanders, or Sheldrakes,
as they are often called, are found both
on the coast and in the interior. Except in certain
mountainous regions, they breed chiefly north
of the United States. The male bird has no crest
and the head is a beautiful green, while the female has a reddish brown crest
and head, shading to white on the chin. They build their nest in hollow trees
near the water. It is made of grasses, leaves and moss and is lined with feathers
from the breast of the female. During May, they lay from six to ten eggs
of a creamy or buff color. Size 2.70 &times; 1.75. Data.--Gun Is., Lake Winnipeg.
June 16, 1903. Eleven eggs in a nest of white down, located between two large

<p>This species is more abundant than the preceding.
It is slightly smaller, being 22 inches in
length, and the male is crested. Found abundantly
in the United States in winter. Breeds commonly
in the interior of British America and in
Labrador and Newfoundland. They make their
nests on the ground, near the water, concealing
them under rocks or tufts of grass. The nest is
made of grasses, leaves and moss and lined with
feathers. They lay, generally, about ten eggs of
a buffy or greenish buff color. Size 2.50 &times; 1.70.

<p>Contrasting with the preceding Fish Ducks, the Mallards are regarded as
one of the most esteemed table birds. They feed on mollusks and marine
insects which they generally reach by tipping in shallow water. They nest in
many localities in the United States but more abundantly north of our borders.
They nest in fields in close proximity to ponds or lakes, placing their nests
of grasses and feathers in the tall grass. In May and June they lay from six
to ten eggs of a buffy or olive color. Size 2.25 &times; 1.25. Data.--San Diego, California,

<p>These are handsome Ducks known as "Whistlers"
from the noise of their wings when flying,
and "Greatheads" because of the puffy crest. The
head is greenish with a large round white spot in
front of, and a little below the eye. The rest of
the plumage is black and white. This species
nests in hollow trees near the water, lining the
cavity with grass, moss and leaves, and lining the

largely white. The central tail feathers
are much lengthened. They breed
abundantly in Greenland, Alaska and the
Hudson Bay Territory, placing their

<p>This species differs from the preceding only in
the fleshy part of the base of the bill, which extends
back on each side of the forehead, it being
broad and rounded in this species and narrow and
pointed in the Northern or Greenland Eider. This
species, but more especially the Northern Eider,
are the ones chiefly used for the eider-down of
commerce. The preceding species is often semi-domesticated
in Greenland, the people protecting
them and encouraging them to nest in the neighborhood.
They make their nests of seaweed and
grass and warmly line it with down from their
breast; this down is continually added to the nest during incubation until
there is a considerable amount in each nest, averaging about an ounce in
weight. The birds are among the strongest of the sea ducks and get their food
in very deep water. Their flesh is not good eating. Their eggs number from

<p>169.1. <span class="sc">Blue Goose.</span> <i>Chen c&aelig;rulescens.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America, principally in the interior, breeding from Hudson
Bay northward and wintering along the Gulf coast.</p>

<p>This species may always be recognized by the entirely white head and neck,
the body being grayish or bluish gray. They nest on the ground as do the
other geese laying from four to eight eggs of a brownish buff color. Size 2.50
&times; 1.75. Data,--Cape Bathurst, Arctic coast, June 29, 1899. Four eggs laid in a
depression lined with grass, on an island. Collected with the parent birds by

is exactly like that of the preceding except that the bill is entirely black,
and the nostril is located nearer the eye. Their nesting habits and eggs are
the same as those of the Whistling Swan. While a few pairs may breed within
the United States by far the greater number are found in the extreme north,
from Hudson Bay to Alaska. The eggs may average a trifle larger than those

<p>Range.--Tropical and sub-tropical America on
the Atlantic coasts, breeding in the Bahamas and
West Indies; north to Florida and casually to the
South Atlantic States.</p>

<p>These remarkable and grotesque appearing
birds attain a length of about 48 inches. The
plumage varies from white to a deep rosy red. It
requires several years for them to attain the perfect
adult plumage, and unlike most birds, they
are in the best of plumage during the winter, the
colors becoming faded as the nesting season approaches.
The birds are especially noticeable because
of the crooked, hollow, scoop-shaped bill,
and the extremely long legs and neck. The feet
are webbed, but more for the purpose of supporting
them upon the mud flats than for use in swimming.
The nests are usually built on a sandy
point of an island; they are mounds of earth, grass
and rubbish from one to two feet in height, the
top being hollowed to receive the eggs. One or
two eggs are a complete set. The shell is pale
blue, but this is covered with a heavy white chalky
deposit. The eggs are laid in June and July.

<p>This bird, with its broad, flat bill, bare head, and rosy plumage with carmine
epaulets and tail coverts, seem more like the fanciful creation of some artist
than a real bird of flesh and blood. Its plumage and colors are strikingly clear
and beautiful. Full plumaged
adult birds have very brilliant
carmine shoulders and tail coverts,
a saffron colored tail, and a
lengthened tuft of bright rosy
feathers on the foreneck. This
species breed in small colonies
in marshy places, often in company
with herons and ibises.
Their nests are rather frail platforms
of sticks, located in bushes
or trees, from four to fifteen
feet from the ground. The eggs
are laid during the latter part
of May and June. They are
three or four in number and
have a ground color of dull
white, or pale greenish blue and
are quite heavily blotched with several shades of brown. Size 2.50 &times; 1.70.</p>

the exception of black primaries. The legs and
the bare skin of the face is orange red. These
birds are very abundant in most marshy localities
along the Gulf coast, especially in Florida, where
they nest in rookeries of thousands of individuals.
Owing to their not having plumes, they have not
been persecuted as have the white herons. They
build their nests of sticks and grasses, in the
mangroves a few feet above the water. In other
localities they build their nests entirely of dead
rushes, attaching them to the standing ones a foot or more above the surface
of the water. They are quite substantially made and deeply cupped, very different
from the nests of the Herons. Their eggs are from three to five in number,
vary from grayish ash to pale greenish or bluish in color, blotched with
light brown. Size 2.25 &times; 1.60. The nesting season is during May and June.

Orinoco River in northern South America.</p>

<p>Full plumaged adults of this species are wholly bright scarlet, except for the
primaries, which are black. Their nests are built in impenetrable thickets,
rushes or mangroves, the nests being constructed like those of the White Ibis.
The eggs, too, are very similar to those of the preceding species, but both the
ground color and the markings average brighter. While still common in some
localities, the species is gradually becoming less abundant, chiefly because of
the demand for their feathers for use in fly-tying.</p>

<p>This species differs from the Glossy Ibis in
having the feathers on the front of the head white,
the rest of the plumage is a dull brownish chestnut,
with greenish reflections on the back. As
these birds are not in demand commercially, their
numbers have not decreased, and thousands of
them breed in colonies in southern Texas. They
build a substantial nest of reeds and rushes woven
about the upright canes, close to the surface of the
water. Their eggs are laid during May, and number
from three to four. They are easily distinguished
from those of the Herons, being of a
deeper greenish blue color and averaging more
elongate. Size 1.95 &times; 1.35. Data.--Corpus Christi,
Texas, May 26, 1899. Four eggs. Nest of twigs
and rushes on side of river. Collector, F. B.
Armstrong.</p>

<h3>Family ARDEIDAE</h3>

<p>Herons and Bitterns are long-legged waders,
having straight, pointed bills, and with the head
feathered, except for the lores.</p>

<p>190. <span class="sc">Bittern.</span> <i>Bautaurus lentiginosus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--United States and southern British

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px"><img alt="" src="images/121b.png">
<p>Brownish drab.</p></div>

<p>This species, with its mottled rusty brownish plumage, is one of the best
known of the Heron family. It is known locally by a great many names, nearly
all of which have reference to the "booming" or "pumping" sound made during
the mating season. They build their nests in swampy or marshy places, placing
them on the ground, frequently on a tussock, entirely surrounded by water.
The nest proper is only a few grasses twisted about to form a lining to the
hollow. They lay from three to five eggs of brownish drab. Size 1.95 &times; 1.50.</p>

<p>They do not breed in colonies, generally, but one or two pairs nesting in one
marsh. Data.--Worcester, Mass., June 3, 1897. Four eggs laid in a grass lined
hollow in middle of a hummock of earth and grass, in middle of marsh. Collector,
James Jackson.</p>

<p>Range.--Common throughout the United States,
especially in the eastern part, and in the southern
British provinces.</p>

<p>This small variety of Bittern is very common
in the southern portions of the United States, but
less so and locally distributed in the northern
portions of its range. They are very quiet and
sly birds, and their presence is often unsuspected
when they are really quite abundant. When approached,
they will remain
perfectly quiet, with
the body erect and the
head and neck pointed
skyward, in which position
their yellowish
brown plumage strongly
resembles the rushes
among which they are
found. Their nests are
made of strips of rushes
woven about upright
stalks, generally over water. They lay from
three to five eggs of a pale bluish white color.
Size 1.20 &times; .90. Data.--Avery's Island, La., May 1,
1896. Four eggs. Nest of strips of rushes woven

been taken in Ontario, Canada, and in several
localities in eastern United States. It is very different from the Least Bittern,
having a more uniform chestnut coloration, especially on the under parts. It is
twelve inches in length. Mr. C. W. Crandall has a set of five eggs of this
species, taken on the Caloosahatchee River, Fla., April 15, 1891, by S. B. Ladd.
Nest was made of grasses and rushes placed in the cane two feet above the

north of there.</p>

<p>This handsome Heron is about four feet in
length. Its general color is a bluish gray, relieved
by a black crest, primaries and patches on the
sides, and a white crown. In the south they breed
in large colonies, often in company with many
other species. In the northern portions of their
range they breed singly or in companies of under
a hundred individuals. They generally place
their rude platforms of sticks well up in trees,
near ponds, swamps or rivers, but in the most
northerly parts of their range, where trees are
scarce, they often build on the ground. Unless
they are disturbed, they return to the same breeding
grounds, year after year. They lay from three to five eggs of a greenish
blue color. Size 2.50 &times; 1.50. Data.--Duck Island, Maine, May 20, 1883. Three

<p>196. <span class="sc">Egret.</span> <i>Herodias egretta.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Resident in the southern portions of
the United States, straggling northward casually
to the northern parts.</p>

<p>This is one of the beautiful Herons which have
been sought by plume hunters till they are upon
the verge of extermination. They are entirely
white, with a long train of beautiful straight
"aigrettes" flowing from the middle of the back.
In remote localities, quite large colonies of them
may still be found, but where they numbered
thousands, years ago, they can be counted by
dozens now. They breed in impenetrable swamps,
very often in company with the following species,
and also with Louisiana and Little Blue
Herons, and White Ibises. Their nests are but
frail platforms, generally in bushes over the
water. Their usual complement of eggs numbers
from three to five, four as the most common number.
They are generally laid during the latter
part of May, but often on account of their being
disturbed, nests with eggs may be found in July.
The eggs are a light bluish green in color. Size
2.25 &times; 1.45. Data.--Gainesville, Florida, April 14, 1894. Four eggs on a platform

the breeding season. In New England they
generally select a remote pine grove as their
breeding grounds. If not disturbed they will return
to this same place each year. Their nests
are built of sticks and lined with small twigs,
and are placed well up towards the tops of the
trees.</p>

<p>Frequently several nests will be found in the
same tree, and I have counted as many as fifty
nests in view at the same time. In large swamps
in the south they generally nest at a low elevation,
while in the marshes of Wisconsin and Minnesota, large colonies of them
nest on the ground, making their nest of rushes. Like all Heronries, those of
this species have a nauseating odor, from the remains of decayed fish, etc.,
which are strewn around the bases of the trees. Their eggs number from three
to five and are of a pale bluish green color. Size 2.00 &times; 1.40. Data.--Uxbridge,
Mass., May 30, 1898. 4 eggs. Nest of sticks, about thirty feet up in a pine tree.
Many other nests. Collector, H. A. Smith.</p>

<p>203. <span class="sc">Yellow-crowned Night Heron</span>. <i>Nyctanassa violacea</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--Sub-tropical America, breeding along the Gulf coast and to Lower
California; casually farther north, to Illinois and South Carolina.</p>

<p>A handsome grayish colored species, with long lanceolate plumes on the
back, and two or three fine white plumes from the back of the head, like those
of the Black-crowned species. Its black head, with tawny white crown and ear
coverts, renders it unmistakable. This species nests in colonies or by pairs,
like the preceding, and very often in company with other Herons. They lay
from three to six eggs, very similar in size, shape and color to those of the
Black-crowned Heron.</p>

<h3>CRANES. Family GRUIDAE</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/129.png">
<p>Whooping Crane.<br>
Little Brown Crane.</p></div>

<p>Cranes are large, long-legged, long-necked birds, somewhat resembling
Herons. Their structure and mode of living partakes more of the nature of
the Rails, however. They are found upon the prairies, where besides shell
fish from the ponds, they feed largely upon grasshoppers, worms, etc.</p>

<p>204. <span class="sc">Whooping Crane.</span> <i>Grus americana.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Interior of North America, breeding
from about the latitude of Iowa northward to the
Arctic regions; winters in the Gulf states and
southward.</p>

<p>The Whooping Crane is the largest of the family
in America, measuring 50 inches or more in
length. The plumage of the adults is pure white,
with black primaries. The bare parts of the head
and face are carmine. It is a very locally distributed
species, in some sections being practically
unknown, while in a neighboring locality it
may be rated as common. They are very shy
birds and are not easily obtained. They nest
either upon the solid earth or in marshy places
over the water. In either case the nest is a very
bulky mass of grass and weeds from two to three
feet in diameter and raised perhaps a foot above
the ground. They lay two eggs of a brownish
buff color, irregularly blotched with brown, and
with fainter marking of gray. Size 3.75 x 2.50.
Data.--Torkton, northern Assiniboia, northwest
Canada. Nest a mass of marsh hay, three feet in
diameter, on the prairie. The birds seen, but very
wary. Collector, Cowbry Brown.</p>

<p>205. <span class="sc">Little Brown Crane.</span> <i>Grus canadensis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America in the interior, breeding
from Hudson Bay and southern Alaska north
to the Arctic coast; south in winter to Mexico.</p>

<p>This uniform gray colored Crane differs from
the next species only in size, being about three
feet in length, while the Sandhill averages three
and one-half feet. The eggs cannot be distinguished
with any certainty.</p>

<p>206. <span class="sc">Sandhill Crane.</span> <i>Grus mexicana.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Temperate North America, breeding
from the Gulf States, locally north to the southern
parts of the British Provinces.</p>

<p>This is the most common and the most southerly
distributed member of the family. In some
sections of Florida and Texas it is regarded as
abundant. They nest in marshy places near secluded
ponds. The nests are masses of grass,
weeds and roots, generally placed in marshes and
entirely surrounded by water. The two eggs are
similar to those of the Whooping Crane, but the
ground color is lighter. The eggs of the two species
cannot always, with certainty, be distinguished.
Size 3.75 x 2.40. Data.--Carman, Manitoba,
May 31, 1903. 2 eggs. Nest on a knoll in a
marsh, hidden by dead rushes and weeds; a flat
loose structure of broken rushes and reeds. Collector,
Chris Forge.</p>

<h2>COURLANS. Family ARAMID&AElig;</h2>

<p>207. <span class="sc">Limpkin.</span> <i>Aramus vociferus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--This bird is a native of the West
Indies and Central America, but occurs regularly
north to the southern portions of Florida.</p>



<p>This strange bird is the only member of its family
found in the United States. It may be likened
to a large Rail or a small Crane, being apparently,
a connecting link between the two. It is about
two feet in length, and the plumage is mottled
brownish and white. It lives in the marshes,
from whence, until late at night, emanate its
strange cries, which are likened to those of a
child in distress. They nest in the most impenetrable
parts of swamps, building their nests of rushes, grass and weeds, in
tangled masses of vines a few feet above the ground or water. They lay from
three to eight eggs having a ground color of buff or grayish white and blotched
with light brown. Their coloration is very similar to those of the Cranes.
Size 2.30 x 1.70. They nest in April and May.</p>

<h2>RAILS, GALLINULES and COOTS. Family RALLID&AElig;</h2>

<p>Members of this family are almost exclusively frequenters of marshes,
where they lead a shy, retiring life and are more often heard than seen.</p>

<p>208. <span class="sc">King Rail.</span> <i>Rallus elegans.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Fresh water marshes of eastern United States from New England
and the Dakotas, southward. Very abundant on the South Atlantic coast, in
the inland marshes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/133a.png">
<p>Cream color.</p></div>

<p>This is one of the largest of the Rails, (17
inches in length) and may be known by the
richness of its plumage, the breast and wing
coverts being a rich cinnamon color. It is
almost exclusively a fresh water species and is
very rarely found around a salt water marsh.
Its nest is built on the ground, in a tuft of grass
and weeds woven about the upright stalks.
They lay from five to twelve eggs having a
cream colored ground, sparingly speckled with
brown and lilac. Size 1.60 &times; 1.20. Data.--Clark
County, Missouri, June 6, 1893. 10 eggs. Nest
composed of reed stalks; a slightly concave mass 8 inches across, and only
two inches above the water, in a clump of reeds. Collector, Ed. S. Currier.</p>

<p>209. <span class="sc">Belding's Rail.</span> <i>Rallus beldingi.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Lower California and the islands in the Gulf.</p>

<p>This is a locally confined species, very similar to the preceding but darker
and with the flank bars narrower. Its nesting or eggs will not differ from those
of the King Rail.</p>

<p>210. <span class="sc">California Clapper Rail.</span> <i>Rallus obsoletus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Salt marshes of the Pacific coast of the United States.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/133b.png">
<p>Light buff.</p></div>
<p>This species is like a dull colored King Rail,
with reference to the markings of the back, or
a bright colored Clapper Rail, as it has a cinnamon
colored breast. It is an abundant species
in nearly all the salt marshes along the coast.
They make their nests on the higher parts of
the marsh, where it is comparatively dry, building
them of grass and strips of rushes. They
lay from four to nine eggs of a light buff color,
boldly spotted with brown, and with fainter
markings of lilac. Size 1.75 &times; 1.25. Data.--Palo
Alto, Cal., May 1, 1899. Nest of marsh
grass under a small bush on bank of slough.

the King Rail is a fresh water one. With the
possible exception of the Carolina or Sora Rail,
this is the most abundant of all the Rails, hundreds
nesting in a single marsh on the South
Atlantic coast. Their nests are built of rushes
and weeds, and are placed on the ground either in
the tall grass bordering the marshes or attached
to the rushes in the midst of the marsh. The
nesting season commences during April and continues
through May. They lay from six to fourteen
eggs, of a buff color spotted irregularly with
brown and gray. Size 1.70 &times; 1.20.</p>

<p>211a. <span class="sc">Louisiana Clapper Rail.</span> <i>Rallus crepitans saturatus.</i></p>

are the "Rail-birds" or "Ortolans" which are annually
slaughtered by thousands, for sport and marketing, during their fall migration.
It is only because of the large families
that they rear, that they are able to withstand this
yearly decimation of their ranks. They nest
either in salt or fresh water marshes, making a
rude structure of grass, weeds and strips of rushes,
on the ground, generally concealed in a tuft of grass
in a tangled swamp or marsh. During May, they
lay from six to sixteen eggs of a bright, buffy gray
color, spotted with reddish brown and lavender.

<p>219. <span class="sc">Florida Gallinule.</span> <i>Gallinula galeata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Temperate North America, from New
England, Manitoba and California, southward.</p>

<p>A grayish colored bird of similar size to the
last (13 inches long), with flanks streaked with
white, and with the bill and crown plate reddish.
They nest in
colonies in
marshes and
swamps, building
their nests
like those of
the Purple

eggs, too, are
similar, but
larger and
slightly duller.
Size 1.75 &times; 1.20.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px"><img alt="" src="images/138b.png">
<p>Pale buff.</p></div>


<p>Data.--Montezuma

eggs. Nest of dead flaggs, floating in two feet of
water. Collector, Robert Warwick.</p>

<p>220. <span class="sc">European Coot.</span> <i>Fulica atra.</i></p>

<p>A European species very similar to the next,

<p>221. <span class="sc">Coot.</span> <i>Fulica americana.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Whole of temperate North America,

southward; very common in suitable localities
throughout its range.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px"><img alt="" src="images/138c.png">
<p>Grayish.</p></div>

<p>The Coot bears some resemblance to the
Florida Gallinule, but is somewhat larger,
its bill is white with a blackish band about
the middle, and each toe has a scalloped
web. They inhabit the same marshes and
sloughs that are used by the Rails and Gallinules
as nesting places, and they have the
same retiring habits, skulking through the
grass to avoid observation, rather than flying.
Their nests are either floating piles
of decayed vegetation, or are built of dead
rushes in clumps of rushes on the banks.
They generally build in large colonies. The
eggs number from six to sixteen and have
a grayish ground color, finely specked all over the surface with blackish. Size
1.80 &times; 1.30.</p>

<h3>PHALAROPES. Family PHALAROPODIDAE</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/139a.png">
<p>Red Phalarope.<br>
Northern Phalarope.</p></div>
<p>Phalaropes are small Plover-like birds, but with lobate webbed feet, similar
to those of the Grebes and Coots.</p>

<p>222. <span class="sc">Red Phalarope.</span> <i>Phalaropus fulicarius.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the
far north, and migrating to the middle portions
of the United States, chiefly on the coasts.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/139b.png">
<p>Greenish buff.</p></div>

<p>The Red Phalarope during the breeding season
has the underparts wholly reddish brown; they
are very rarely seen in the United States in this
dress, however for it is early changed for a suit
of plain gray and white.
This species has a much
stouter bill than the two
following; it is about nine
inches in length. All the
Phalaropes are good swimmers,
and this species, especially,
is often found in
large flocks off the coast,
floating on the surface of
the water; they feed largely upon small marine
insects. Nests in hollows on the ground, lined
with a few grasses. The eggs are three or four
in number, generally of a greenish buff color,
spotted and blotched with brown and blackish.
Data.--Myvates, Iceland, June 19, 1897. Collector,
C. Jefferys.</p>

<p>223. <span class="sc">Northern Phalarope.</span> <i>Lobipes labatus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the
northern parts of the British Provinces.</p>



<p>This is the smallest of the Phalaropes, being
about eight inches long; in summer it has a
chestnut band across the breast and on the side
of the neck.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/139c.png">
<p>Greenish buff.</p></div>

<p>Its habits and nesting habits vary
but little from those of the Red Phalarope, although
its distribution is a little more southerly,
and it is not as exclusively maritime as the preceding
species. It is found on both coasts of the
United States, but more common on the Pacific side,
during the fall and spring, when going to or returning
from its winter quarters in the tropics.
Their eggs cannot, with certainty, be distinguished
from the preceding species.</p>

<p>The Avocet can be known from any other bird
by its up-curved bill, light plumage, webbed feet
and large size (length about 17 inches). These
waders are quite numerous in suitable localities
throughout the west, constructing their nests in
the grass, bordering marshy places. The nest is
simply a lining of grass in a hollow in the ground.
They lay three or four eggs of a dark greenish

<p>This is one of the most eagerly sought game
birds of the east. Their flight is very rapid and
erratic, and accompanied by a peculiar whistling
sound made by the rapid motion of the wings; it
requires a skillful
marksman to
bring them down.
They frequent
boggy places especially
"runs"
lined with alders,
where they bore
in the soft ground
for worms and
grubs. Their
eggs are laid upon
the bare
ground among
the leaves and sticks; they are of about the color
of dead leaves, as is also the bird, making it quite
difficult to discover their nests. They lay three

<p>Range.--Coast and islands of Bering Sea, south
in winter to southern Alaska.</p>

<p>This bird, which is ten inches in length, has
the feathers of the upper parts edged with
rusty, and the underparts light, with a distinguishing
patch of black on the breast. Similar in
appearance to the Red-backed Sandpiper, but not
so reddish above, and the latter has the black
patch on the belly. They breed commonly on
the Pribilof and other islands in Bering Sea,
nesting the same as other Sandpipers. Their four
eggs are similar to those of the preceding, but
average darker. Size 1.50 &times; 1.05.</p>

<p>238. <span class="sc">Sharp-tailed Sandpiper</span>. <i>Pisobia aurita</i>.</p>

south in winter, wholly on the Asiatic side of
the Pacific.</p>

<p>A similar bird, in appearance, to the following,
but slightly smaller and with the breast more
ruddy. Its nesting habits probably do not differ

of the United States during migrations.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/149b.png">
</div>

<p>This species is blackish brown above, with
light brown edgings to the feathers, and white
below, except the chest, which is brownish,
streaked with black. A very peculiar species,
having the power, during the mating season, of inflating
the throat to a great extent, making a balloon-like
appendage, nearly the size of the bird. They
have more the habits of Snipe, than do most of the
Sandpipers, frequenting grassy meadows or marshes,
in preference to the seashore. Their nests are
grass lined depressions, and the eggs are grayish
or greenish buff, blotched with brown. Size 1.45 &times;
1.00. Data.--Cape Smythe, Alaska, June 1900. Four
eggs in a hollow in the ground, lined with grass.</p>

from central to Southern South America;
most common on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>This species is 7.5 inches in length, and has
white upper tail coverts; otherwise it is marked
similarly to the preceding Sandpiper. Its nesting
habits are the same as those of the majority
of the family, and the three or four eggs that they
lay cannot be distinguished from those of the following
species. Size 1.30 &times; .90. These are one
of the most common of the beach birds along
the Atlantic coast during migrations; they are
very often known as Bonaparte Sandpipers.</p>

<p>241. <span class="sc">Baird's Sandpiper</span>. <i>Pisobia bairdi</i>.</p>

<p>Range.--North America, chiefly in the interior,
breeding along the Arctic coast and about Hudson
Bay, and wintering south of the United
States.</p>

<p>A very similar species to the preceding, but
without the white rump. Their nests are hollows
in the ground, generally concealed in a tuft of
grass, and lined with grasses and a few leaves.
They lay three or four eggs having a grayish
colored ground, and marked with different shades
of brown, and also with some faint markings of
lilac. Size 1.30 &times; .90. Data.--Peel River, Arctic
America, June 18, 1898. Four eggs, taken with
the bird by an Indian. Eggs in a slight hollow
on the river bank.</p>

<p>242. <span class="sc">Least Sandpiper</span>. <i>Pisobia minutilla</i>.</p>

in the interior and on both coasts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/150b.png">
<p>Grayish.</p></div>

<p>This is the smallest of our Sandpipers, being under six
inches in length. Except for size, they are similar in
appearance to Baird's Sandpiper, only the back is browner.
A very abundant species during migrations, being found
on the seashore or in marshes, nearly always in company
with other species of the family. Their nests are the same
as other Sandpipers, and the eggs are grayish, thickly
specked with brown. Size 1.15 &times; .80. Data.--Peel River,
Arctic America, June 20, 1899. Nest simply a depression

<p>Range.--Whole of North America, but chiefly
in the eastern and central parts, breeding about
the ponds and streams of Labrador and Hudson
Bay, and northward. These little Sandpipers are
abundant during the migrations either in marshes
or on beaches. They are most often found in

<p>A handsome and abundant species, found during
migrations by thousands on beaches and about
large bodies of water in the interior. They are
one of the lightest colored of the Sandpipers,
either in winter or summer plumage. In summer
the upper parts are a light rusty color and black,
and the whole underparts are white. Owing to
their extreme northerly distribution in summer,
but few of their eggs have been taken. Their
nesting habits are like those of the other Sandpipers.
The three or four eggs are greenish buff in
color, spotted and blotched with brown. Size 1.45 &times; .95. Data.--Peel River,

is 19 inches in length, is of a nearly uniform ruddy color and is handsomely
marbled above, and barred below with black. Their eggs are laid upon the
ground in the vicinity of ponds or rivers; sometimes there is no lining and
again a few straws or grasses may be twisted around the depression. Their
eggs number three or four and have a ground color of grayish or greenish buff,
sometimes quite dark, and are blotched with dark brown. Size 2.25 &times; 1.60.

The legs, as implied by the name of the bird, are yellow and long; length of bird, 14 inches. They nest most abundantly in localities remote from habitations, in the interior of Canada. The eggs are generally laid on the ground, near a marsh or on the bank of a stream, with little or no lining to the nest. They are grayish white, boldly splashed with several shades of brown, and with lilac. Size 1.65 &times; 1.25. Data.--Whale River, Labrador, June 10, 1902.

<p>A bird with a greenish gray back, barred with white, and white below; length 8.5 inches. This species is one of the oddities among the waders. They are most always met with, singly or in pairs, and are very rarely seen, even in very small flocks. Their preference is for small ponds or streams in wet woods or open meadows, rather than marshes which are frequented by other species. They are occasionally seen during the nesting season, even in the southern parts of their range, and they probably breed there although their eggs are very rarely found. The eggs are clay-colored, spotted with brownish black. Data.--Simco Island, Kingston, Ontario, June 10, 1898. 5 eggs in a shallow depression on the ground, lined with a few grasses.</p>

<p>These large waders are among the most abundant of the marsh or beach
birds. They breed in small companies in marshes, frequently in those which
are covered with water at high tide, building a frail nest of grasses and weeds,
where it will be barely out of reach of the highest water. The three or four
eggs have a brownish, or sometimes greenish, buff ground color and are blotched
with umber, and have fainter markings of lilac. Size 2.00 &times; 1.50. Data.--Sandy
Bank, South Carolina, May 3, 1901. Nest on the ground, secreted in the
high grass. Made of dead marsh grass, lined with finer grasses.</p>

<p>A small wader about 7.5 inches in length, with
brownish gray upper parts, and white underparts
thickly spotted with blackish, especially on the
breast and flanks. This is the most abundant of
all the shore birds, and its "peet-weet" is a familiar
sound to every country boy. It has a peculiar
habit of continually moving its tail up and down,
when at rest on a stone or when running along
the shore; from these characteristic actions it
has received the very common names of "Teeter-tail"
and "Tip-up." They build their nests on the
ground near ponds, brooks or marshes, generally
concealing it in a tuft of grass or weeds on the
shore or in the high grass at the edge of the
meadows. The eggs number from three to five and are of a grayish buff color,
spotted and blotched with blackish brown. The young, like those of all the
shore birds, are hatched covered with down, and run about as soon as born.
They are anxiously attended by the parents and at
the least sign of danger, conceal themselves beneath
a tuft of grass or behind a small stone, where they
remain perfectly motionless until called by the old
birds. The adults frequently attempt to lead an enemy
away from the young by feigning a broken
wing, or lameness. Size of eggs 1.35 &times; .90. Data.--Parker
County, Ind., May 22, 1901. Nest about six
yards from bank of creek, among weeds on a sand
bar; a hollow in the sand lined with weeds. Collector,

<p>Small web between the bases of the two outer
toes. Single broad, black band across the breast;
black line from base of bill to eye. They are very
abundant on our seacoast in Fall, both in flocks
composed entirely of their own kind, and also
with Least and Semipalmated Sandpipers. They
usually keep on the inner side of sandbars or
muddy flats bordering marshes, rather than on the
open ocean beach. It is also found in smaller
flocks, about ponds and marshes in the interior of
the country. They are usually unsuspicious and will allow a close approach, or
if you are still, will run by within a very few feet. Nest on the ground; eggs
buffy, sparsely specked with black, 1.30 &times; .90; June.</p>

Their three or four

<p>A handsome little bird, with a black crescent
on each side of neck, a small black patch on top
of the head, and without any black on the lores
or ear coverts. It is the lightest colored of any
of the eastern Plovers. Length, 7 inches. Young,
similar, but the black replaced by grayish, as is
the case with the last species. This species, apparently, never could be classed
as abundant and of late years, it is becoming rather rare along our Atlantic
coast; this is probably more due to the building of
summer resorts and homes along their former breeding
grounds than to hunters. They are rather more shy
than the last species, but will usually attempt to escape
by running along the beach or by hiding, rather
than by flight. Owing to their light colors it is very
difficult to see them at any distance. They lay their
eggs upon the sandy beaches in slight, and generally
unlined, hollows. The eggs have a pale clay colored
ground and are sparsely specked with small black
dots. Size 1.25 x 1.00.</p>

Greenland to Alaska. Its habits and eggs are precisely like the next.</p>

<p>283a. <span class="sc">Ruddy Turnstone.</span> <i>Arenaria interpres morinella.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Breeds in the Arctic regions, and migrates through all parts of the
United States, south to the southern parts of South America. This species has
the upperparts variegated with reddish brown, black and white; the underparts
are pure white, except for a black patch on the throat, branching upward to the
eye and back to the sides of the breast. It has a peculiar, slightly up-turned
bill, which is used, as their name implies, for turning over pebbles and stones
in their search for food. They nest commonly in northern Labrador, about
Hudson Bay and in Alaska, laying their eggs in scantily lined hollows on the
ground, near water. The eggs are very peculiar and beautiful, having a light
grayish or cream color ground, peculiarly marbled with many shades of brown

<p>A celebrated "game bird" which has been hunted
so assiduously in New England that it is upon
the verge of extermination, and the covers have
to be continually replenished with birds trapped
in the south and west. They frequent open fields,
which have a luxuriant
growth of weeds, or
grain fields in the fall.
Their nests are built
along the roadsides, or
beside stonewalls or
any place affording satisfactory
shelter. The
nest is made of dried
grasses and is arched
over with grass or
overhanging leaves so as to conceal the eggs.
They lay from ten to twenty pure white eggs,
which are very frequently nest stained when

<p>Reddish buff.</p></div>

<p>This is the largest of the Partridges, being 11
inches in length. It is of a general grayish color,
with chestnut throat patch, and chestnut flanks,
barred with white.
Two long plumes extend
downward from
the back of the head.
This species nests
abundantly in the
mountainous portions
of northern California
and throughout Oregon,
and is gradually increasing
in numbers in
Washington. As a rule
they nest only on the
higher mountain ranges, placing their nest of
leaves under the protection of an overhanging
bush or tuft of grass. Their eggs number from
six to fifteen, and are of a pale reddish buff color.
Size 1.35 &times; 1.05.</p>

<p>292a. <span class="sc">Plumed Quail.</span> <i>Oreortyx picta plumifera.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Mountain ranges of California and

that it is grayer on the back of the head and
neck. Its nesting habits and eggs are like the
preceding.</p>

<p>292b. <span class="sc">San Pedro Quail.</span> <i>Oreortyx picta confinis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--San Pedro Mountains, Lower California.</p>

<p>This species, which is grayer above than the preceding two, breeds only in

<p>Creamy white.</p></div>
<p>Range.--Mexico and southwestern border of the United States.</p>

<p>This blue gray species is 10 inches in length; the
feathers on the neck and underparts have narrow
dark borders, thus giving the plumage a scaly appearance,
from which the birds take their name.
They have a small tuft of whitish or buffy feathers
on the top of the head. It is especially abundant in
the dry arid portions of its range, being found often
many miles away from water. Their eggs are laid
in a shallow hollow under some small bush or cactus,
and number from eight to sixteen; they are creamy
white, finely specked with buff or pale brownish.

both on the mountains and in the valleys, and
apparently without any regard to the nearness to, or
remoteness from a water supply. They breed during

<p>Range.--Mexico, north to southern Arizona

<p>A remarkable species about 9 inches long;
often called "Fool Quail" because of its eccentric
and clownish markings, streaks and spots
of black, white, buff, gray and chestnut. It is
met with in small flocks on the mountains and
less frequently in the valleys. It frequents
scrubby wooded places rather than open hill
sides and is very easy to approach and kill;
this confidence or stupidity together with its
clownish appearance are the reasons for its
commonly used local name. Their nests are
hollows in the ground, lined with grasses and
concealed by overhanging tufts of grass. The
eggs, which are pure white, are not distinguishable
with certainty from those of the Bob-white,
but average longer. Size 1.25 &times; .95.</p>

being about 20 inches in length. The general tone of its plumage below is
gray; above, blackish gray and the tail blackish with a broad terminal band of
light gray. They frequent the wooded and especially the coniferous districts,
where they build their nests under fallen trees or at the bases of standing ones.
They lay from six to ten eggs of a buffy color, sparsely spotted and blotched
with brownish. Size 2.00 &times; 1.40.</p>

long), and easily recognized by its black throat
and extensive black patch on the breast. The
habits of this species
and the two varieties
into which it
has been sub-divided
are the same; as a
species, they are
very tame, will not
fly unless actually
obliged to, and frequently
allow themselves
to be knocked
down with sticks.
Their nests are hollows

<p>Brownish buff.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Northwestern United States and British
Columbia.</p>

<p>This species is very similar to the Canada
Grouse, the most apparent difference being the
absence of the brownish gray tip to the tail, and
the upper coverts are broadly tipped with white.
This species,
which is very
abundant in the
northwest, has
the same stupid
habits of the eastern
bird. During
the mating season,
the males of
both this and the
preceding species
have the same
habit of "drumming"
that the
Ruffed Grouse has. Their nests are placed on
the ground under bushes or fir trees and from
eight to fifteen eggs are laid. These are brownish
buff in color, spotted and blotched with rich
brown. They are very similar to the eggs of the
Canada Grouse. Data.--Moberly Peak, Cascade
Mts., British Columbia, June 9, 1902. 7 eggs in a
slight hollow on the ground. Collector, G. F.
Dippie.</p>

<p>300. <span class="sc">Ruffed Grouse.</span> <i>Bonasa umbellus umbellus.</i></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/182c.png">
<p>Brownish buff.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Eastern United States from Minnesota
to New England; south to Virginia.</p>

<p>The Ruffed Grouse is "King of the Game Birds"
in the east, where it has been hunted so freely,
that it has become very wary and requires a skillful
marksman to bring it down. Because of the
cutting off of all heavy timber, and the vigor with
which they are pursued by hunters, they are becoming
very scarce in New England, and within
a few years they will probably be practically extinct
in that section. Their favorite resorts are
heavily timbered woods or low growth birches.
Their nests are hollows in the leaves under fallen
trees, beside some stump or concealed among the
small shoots at the base of a large tree. The bird
sits very close, but when she does fly, goes with the familiar rumble and roar
which always disconcerts the novice, the wind created by her sudden flight
generally causing the leaves to settle in the nest and conceal the eggs. They
lay from eight to fifteen eggs, of a brownish buff color, sometimes with a few
faint markings of brown, but generally unspotted. Size 1.55 &times; 1.15. The young
of all the Partridges and Grouse are born covered with down and follow their
parents soon after leaving the shell. The adults are very skillful in leading
enemies away from their young, feigning lameness, broken wings, etc. The
nesting habits and eggs of the three sub-species are precisely the same in every
respect as those of this bird.</p>

in winter being nearly pure white, and in
summer largely reddish brown or grayish, barred
with black.
In the breeding
plumage they
have red comb-like
wattles over
the eye. In other
seasons, their
plumage varies in
all degrees between
winter and
summer. They
nest on the
ground in hollows
among the leaves,
lined with a few grasses, and sometimes feathers.
They lay from six to sixteen eggs which have a
ground color of buff or brownish buff, heavily
speckled, blotched and marbled with blackish
brown. Size 1.75 &times; 1.25.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/186.png">
<p>Buff.</p></div>
<p>Range.--Newfoundland.</p>

<p>This species, in summer, is more grayish
than the Rock Ptarmigan, and is very finely
vermiculated with blackish. It is a perfectly
distinct species from the Allen Ptarmigan,
which is the only other species found on the
island. They inhabit the higher ranges and
hills in the interior of the island, where they
are quite abundant. They build their nests on
the ground under protection of overhanging
bushes. The eggs are laid in a hollow in the
dead leaves, sometimes with a lining of grasses.
The eggs do not differ in size or appearance
from those of the Rock Ptarmigan. Data.--Newfoundland, June 3, 1901. Nest
a slight hollow in the moss, besides a fallen stump; lined with a few feathers.

<p>304. <span class="sc">White-tailed Ptarmigan.</span> <i>Lagopus leucurus leucurus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Higher ranges of the Rocky Mountains, from New Mexico north to
Alaska.</p>

<p>Ptarmigan are remarkable birds in that they are in an almost continual state
of molting, nearly every month in the year showing them in different stages of
plumage, ranging from the snow-white winter dress to the summer one in which
reddish-brown prevails on Willow Ptarmigan and a black and gray barred effect
predominates on the other species. Notice that they are feathered to the toes,
in winter the feathers on the toes growing dense and hair-like, not only protecting
the toes from the cold but making excellent snowshoes which enable them
to walk with impunity over the lightest snow.</p>

<p>Ptarmigan form the staple article of diet for northern foxes, and were it not
for the fact that their plumage changes to correspond to the appearance of the
ground at the various seasons they would fare hardly indeed.</p>

<p>In spring the little red combs above the eyes of the males are swollen and
conspicuous. At this season they strut and perform curious antics, such as all
Grouse are noted for.</p>

<p>This species differs from any of the preceding in having at all seasons of the
year, a white tail; it is also somewhat smaller than the Rock Ptarmigan. They
nest abundantly near the summits of the ranges in Colorado, making their
nests among the rocks, and generally lining them with a few grasses. During
June, they lay from six to twelve eggs having a creamy background, speckled
and blotched with chestnut brown. Size 1.70 x 1.15.</p>

<p>304a. <span class="sc">Kenai White-tailed Ptarmigan.</span> <i>Lagopus leucurus peninsularis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--The prairies, chiefly west of the Mississippi; north to Manitoba, east

<p>This familiar game bird of the west is about 18 inches in length, brownish
above and grayish below, with bars of brownish black both above and below.
In the place of the ruffs of the Ruffled Grouse, are long tufts of rounded or
square ended feathers, and beneath these a peculiar sac, bright orange in the breeding</p>

the Ruffed Grouse. Mr. Brewster probably has the only authentic set of the
eggs of this species. They are of a yellowish green color and are unspotted.

<p>Range.--Eastern United States from southern
Middle States south to central Florida and west
to the Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas. These
magnificent birds, which once ranged over the
whole of eastern United States, are being yearly
confined to a smaller range, chiefly because of the
destruction of their natural covers, and from persecution
by hunters. They are generally very
wary birds and either escape by running through
the underbrush or by flying as soon as a human
being appears in sight. Their nests are made
under tangled growths of underbrush or briers.
Their eggs, which are laid during April and May,
range from eight to sixteen in number. They are
of a buff color sprinkled and spotted with brownish.

<h3>Family COLUMBIDAE</h3>

<p>Pigeons and doves are distributed throughout nearly every temperate and

<p>This large species may be generally recognized
by the white crescent on the nape; it is about 15
inches in length. They nest abundantly on the
mountain ranges, sometimes in large flocks, and
again, only a few pairs together. Their nests are
rude platforms of sticks and twigs either in bushes
or in large trees in heavily wooded districts. The

<p>This species, characterized by its red bill, purplish colored head, neck and
breast and absence of iridescent markings, is abundant in the valley of the
Lower Rio Grande, where they build their frail nests in thickets and low bushes,
and during May and June lay their white eggs. Size of eggs, 1.55 &times; 1.05.</p>

<p>314. <span class="sc">White-crowned Pigeon.</span> <i>Columba leucocephala.</i></p>

<h2>VULTURES, HAWKS and OWLS. Order XII. RAPTORES</h2>

<h3>AMERICAN VULTURES. Family CATHARTIDAE</h3>

<p>Vultures are peculiarly formed birds of prey, having a bare head and neck, a
lengthened bill strongly hooked at the end for tearing flesh, and long, strong,
broad wings upon which they float in the air for hours at a time without any
visible flapping. They are scavengers and do great service to mankind by devouring
dead animal matter, that, if allowed to remain, would soon taint the
atmosphere. Their eyesight and sense of smell is very acute. They do not,
except in very unusual cases, capture their prey, but feed upon that which has
been killed or died of disease.</p>

<p class="mid"><img alt="" src="images/200.png"><br>
Ashy gray.</p>

<p>324. <span class="sc">California Vulture.</span> <i>Gymnogyps californianus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Apparently now restricted to the coast ranges of California, casually
inland to Arizona, and formerly to British Columbia.</p>

<p>This large bird, which weighs about 20 pounds, measures about 4 feet in
length, and has an expanse of wings of about 10 feet. Its plumage is blackish
with lengthened lanceolate feathers about the neck, and with the greater wing
coverts broadly tipped with grayish white (in very old birds). The birds are
very rare in their restricted range and are becoming scarcer each year, owing to
their being shot and their nests robbed. While the eggs are very rarely found
and only secured at a great risk, they are not as unobtainable as many suppose,
as may be seen from the fact that one private collection contains no less than
six perfect specimens of the eggs and as many mounted birds. These birds lay
but a single egg, placing it generally in caves or recesses in the face of cliffs,
hundreds of feet from the ground, and often in inaccessible locations. The eggs
are of an ashy gray color and measure about 4.45 &times; 1.55.</p>

America, wintering in the southern half of the United
States.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px"><img alt="" src="images/201b.png">
<p>Creamy white.</p></div>

<p>The plumage of this small Buzzard (length 30 inches) is blackish brown, the
naked head being red. It is very common in the southern and central portions
of its range, where it frequents the streets and door yards picking up any refuse
that is edible. It is a very graceful bird while on the wing, and can readily be
identified when at a distance from the fact that, when in flight, the tips of the
wings curve upward. The two eggs which constitute a set are laid upon the
ground between large rocks, in hollow stumps, under logs, or between the
branching trunks of large trees, generally in large woods. They frequently
nest in communities and again, only a single pair may be found in the woods.
Its nesting season ranges from March until June in the different localities.
The eggs are creamy or bluish white, spotted and blotched with shades of brown,
and with fainter markings of lavender. Size 2.70 &times; 1.85.</p>

<p>326. <span class="sc">Black Vulture.</span> <i>Catharista uruba.</i></p>

<p>Range.--More southerly than the preceding; north regularly to North Carolina
and southern Illinois, and west to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>This species is about the same size, or slightly smaller than the Turkey
Vulture; its plumage is entirely black as is also the naked head, and bill. In
the South Atlantic and Gulf States, the present species is even more abundant
than the preceding, and might even be said to be partially domesticated. The
nesting habits are the same as those of the Turkey Buzzard but their eggs
average longer and the ground color is pale greenish or bluish white rather than
creamy. They are spotted and blotched the same. Size 3.00 &times; 2.00.</p>

<p>Range.--Whole of North America, wintering in the United States and southward;
breeds throughout its range, but most abundantly in northern United
States and northward. This is one of the smallest of the hawks and in the
adult plumage is a beautiful species, being barred
below with light brown, and having a bluish
slate back. It is a very spirited and daring
bird and is one of the most destructive to small
birds and young chickens. Its nest is a rude
and sometimes very frail platform of twigs and
leaves placed against the trunk of the tree at
any height, but averaging, perhaps, fifteen feet.
The eggs are bluish white, beautifully blotched
and spotted with shades of brown.</p>

<p>This is one of the handsomest of the larger
hawks, and is the best known in the east,
where it is commonly, but wrongly, designated as "hen hawk", a name, however,
which is indiscriminately applied to any bird that has talons and a hooked
beak. The adult of this species is unmistakable because of its reddish brown
tail; young birds are very frequently confounded with other species. Their
food consists chiefly of small rodents, snakes and lizards, and only occasionally
are poultry or birds taken. They nest in the tallest trees in large patches of
woods, the nests being made of sticks, weeds, leaves and trash. The eggs
number from two to four, and are white, sometimes heavily, and sometimes
sparingly, blotched and spotted with various shades of brown. Size 2.35 x 1.80.</p>

a nearly uniform sooty above and

<p>The Rough-legs are large, heavily built birds of prey, specially characterized
by the completely feathered legs. The present species is 22 inches long, and in
the normal plumage has a whitish head, neck, breast and tail, the former being
streaked and the latter barred
with blackish; the remainder of
the upper and underparts are blackish
brown. Their nests are usually
placed in trees, and less often on
the ground than those of the next
species. These Rough-legs are very
irregularly distributed, and are nowhere
as common as the next.
While the greater number nest
north of the United States, it is
very probable that a great many

<p>Range.--North America, west of the Mississippi, breeding from the latitude
of Colorado north to the Saskatchewan region.</p>

<p>This species nests very abundantly along our northern states, particularly in
Dakota. It is a larger bird than the preceding and can easily be told by its
reddish coloration, particularly on the shoulders and tibia. While in some
localities they nest only in trees, the greater number appear to build their nests
on the ground or rocky ledges, making a large heap of sticks, weeds and grass.
Their three or four eggs are white, beautifully spotted and blotched, in endless
variety, with various shades of brown. Size 2.60 x 2.00. Data.--Stark Co., N.
D., April 29, 1900. Nest built of coarse sticks on a clay butte.</p>

<p>Golden Eagle.</p></div>

<p>Range.--North America, west of the Mississippi;
most abundant in the Rockies and along
the Pacific coast ranges.</p>

<p>This magnificent bird, which is even more
powerful than the Bald Eagle, measures about
34 inches long, and spreads about 7 feet. Its
plumage is a rich brownish black, very old
birds being golden brown on the nape. They
can be distinguished in all plumages from the
Bald Eagle by the completely feathered tarsus.
They build their nests in the tops of the tallest
trees in the wild, mountainous country of the
west, and more rarely upon ledges of the cliffs.
The nests are made of large sticks, lined with
smaller ones and leaves and weeds. Their eggs
are the most handsome of the Raptores, being
white in color, and blotched, splashed, spotted
and specked with light brown and clouded with
gray or lilac, of course varying endlessly in
pattern and intensity. Size 2.90 x 2.50. Data.--Monterey
Co., Cal., May 3, 1888. Three eggs.
Nest of sticks, lined with pine needles, in a
pine tree, 50 feet up.</p>

<p>Range.--Whole of North America; most abundant on the Atlantic
coast; breeds throughout its range. This large white-headed and white-tailed
species is abundant in sufficiently wild localities along the Atlantic
coast. It only attains the white head and tail when three years old,
the first two years, being blackish. It is about 34 inches in length
and expands about seven feet, never over eight feet, and only birds of the second
year (when they are larger than the adults) ever approach this expanse.
Their food consists of fish (which they sometimes capture themselves, but
more often take from the Osprey), carrion, and Ducks, which they catch in
flight. Their nests are massive structures of sticks, in the tops of tall trees.
They very rarely lay more than two eggs, which are white. Size 2.75 x 2.10.

<p>Buff.</p></div>

<p>Gyrfalcons are large, strong, active and fearless
birds, about 23 inches in length. Their food consists chiefly of hares,
Ducks and Waders which abound in the far north. The present species is
snowy white, more or less barred with blackish brown on the back and wings
and with a few marks on the breast. They nest upon the ledges of high cliffs,
laying three or four eggs of a buffy color, blotched and finely specked with
reddish brown, this color often concealing the ground color. Size of eggs, 2.30 &times;
1.80. In America, they nest in Greenland and the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>OSPREY. Family Pandionidae</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px"><img alt="" src="images/227a.png">
<p>American Osprey.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Whole of temperate
America from the Arctic circle
south to the equator, most abundant
along the sea coasts.</p>

<p>Real old birds have the head
whiter, and less white edging
to the back feathers, than do
the young. Feet very strong,
and very hard and rough, perfectly
adapted to grasping slippery
fish; outer toe can be used
equally as well, either in front
or behind, when perching or
grasping their prey.</p>

<p>Probably this great fisherman
is as well known from one end
of the country to the other as
any of our wild birds. He is
protected by law in a great many
states and by custom in nearly
all localities where they breed.
It is one of the pleasantest
sights along the coast to watch
a number of these great birds
as they soar at an elevation
above the water, watching for
fish to come near the surface, when, with folded wings, the bird speeds downward
and plunges into the water, rarely missing his prey. In many localities
they are very tame and nest in the vicinity of houses, sometimes even in the
yard. Their nests are platforms of sticks, which, being used year after year
and constantly added to, become of enormous proportions. They lay two or
three eggs of a bright creamy color, handsomely blotched with bright chestnut
brown. They show a great diversity of size as well as markings, but average
2.40 &times; 1.80.</p>

<p>This is one of the lightest colored of the
Owls; it has a long, peculiarly hooded face,
from which it gets the name of "Monkey-faced
Owl." Its plumage is yellowish buff, specked and barred lightly with blackish.</p>

<p>It nests usually in hollow cavities of trees, but appears to have no objections
to barns, holes in banks, or anywhere it can find a concealed crevice in which
to deposit its four to six pure white eggs; size 1.70 &times; 1.30.</p>

and barred underparts. Their food consists
almost entirely of small rodents, which they
catch at night. Most of their nests are found
in trees, they generally using old Crow's or
Hawk's nests. They also, in some localities,
nest in hollow trees, or in crevices among
rocks. They lay from four to seven pure white
eggs; size 1.55 &times; 1.35.</p>

<p>This is a dark grayish and white bird, 10 inches in length, and without ear
tufts. Breeds commonly in the extensively wooded districts of British America,
chiefly in the northern parts. Their three or four white eggs are usually at

<p>This well known
species, which is often
called "Little
Horned Owl" because
of its ear tufts
is found either in the
type form of some of
its varieties in all
parts of the United
States. They have
two color phases, the
plumage being either
a yellowish brown or
gray, and black and white; these color phases
are not dependent upon sex or locality, as often
young or both phases are found in the same
nest; the gray phase is the most abundant.
They nest anywhere in hollow trees, being
found very frequently in decayed stubs of apple trees. They also often nest in
barns or other old buildings which are not frequented too freely. Their food
consists chiefly of mice and meadow moles, with occasionally small birds.
During April or May they lay their white eggs, the full complement of which
is from five to eight. Size 1.35 &times; 1.20. The nesting habits of all the sub-species,
as far as we can learn, are exactly like those of the eastern Screech Owl; the

very early, January, February and March. Deserted Hawk's or Crow's nests
are very frequently used by this bird, if they are located in dense woods. They
also sometimes nest in hollow cavities in large trees. They lay from two to
four pure white eggs. Size 2.25 &times; 1.85.</p>

<p>375a. <span class="sc">Western Horned Owl.</span> <i>Bubo virginianus pallescens.</i></p>

specimens heavily and broadly barred with blackish brown. It is, next to the
Great Gray Owl, the largest species found in America, being 2 feet in length.
Like the Great Horned Owls, they are very strong, fearless, and rapacious birds,

<p>Range.--Northern North America, breeding

Mountains in the northern tier of states and
casually farther.</p>

<p>This handsome mottled and barred, gray and
black Owl might readily be mistaken for a
Hawk, because of his Hawk-like appearance
and long rounded tail. They are very active birds, especially in the day time,
for they are more diurnal than nocturnal; their food is mostly of small rodents,
and also small birds. They nest either in the tops of large fir trees, in hollows
of stumps, or, in some cases, upon the ground. When in trees their nests are
made of twigs, leaves and weeds, and sometimes lined with moss and feathers;
they lay from three to eight white eggs, size 1.50 &times; 1.20. Data.--Labrador, May
3, 1899. Five eggs. Nest in the top of a dead tree, 15 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Range.--Western North America from the Mississippi
Valley west to California; north to the southern parts
of British America and south to Central America.</p>

<p>These peculiar birds are wholly different in plumage,
form and habits from any other American Owls. They
can readily be recognized by their long, slender and
scantily feathered legs. Their plumage is brownish,
spotted with white above, and white, barred with brown
below; length 10 inches. They nest, generally in large
communities in burrows in the ground, usually deserted
Prairie Dog holes. While generally but a single pair
occupy one burrow, as many as twenty have been found nesting together.
Sometimes the burrows are unlined, and again may have a carpet of grasses
and feathers. Their white eggs generally number from six to ten; size 1.25 &times;
1.00. Data.--Sterling, Kans., May 7, 1899. Nest of bits of dry dung at the end of
a deserted Prairie Dog burrow.</p>

similar to our common

are deep buff. It
is a common species and
nests abundantly in the
West Indies, but occurs
only in limited numbers
in southern Florida.
Their nests are shallow
platforms of twigs and rootlets, placed in
bushes and low trees, and upon which they lay
three or four pale greenish blue eggs, similar
to those of the Yellow-billed species but averaging
smaller; size 1.15 &times; .85.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/246c.png">
<p>Pale greenish blue.</p></div>

<p>This species is generally abundant in all localities in its range, which afford
suitable nesting places of tangled underbrush or vines. It may be distinguished
from the Black-billed variety by its larger size (12 inches long), blackish tail
with broad white tips, and yellowish lower mandible. They are often regarded
by the superstitious as forecasters of rain, and as
omens, probably because of their gutteral croaking
notes.</p>

<p>Their nests are made of twigs, lined with shreds
of grape vine bark or catkins; the nests are generally
very shabbily made and so flat on the top that
the eggs frequently roll off. They are located near
the ground in bushes or low trees. The three or four
eggs are deposited at intervals of several days, and
frequently young birds and eggs are found in
the nest at the same time. Like the Flicker, this
bird will frequently continue laying if one egg is
removed at a time, and as many as twelve have been taken from the same nest,
by this means. The eggs are light greenish blue. Size 1.20 &times; .90. They are
usually laid during May or June.</p>

<p>Greenish blue.</p></div>

<p>This species is rather
more common in the
northern part of the
United States than the
Yellow-billed variety.
The bird is smaller, has
a blackish bill, and the
tail is the same color as
the back and only slightly
tipped with white.
Their nests are built in
similar locations and of the same materials as used by the Yellow-bill; the three
or four eggs are smaller and a darker shade of greenish blue. Size 1.15 &times; .85.
All the Cuckoos are close sitters and will not leave the nest until nearly reached
with the hand, when they will slowly flutter off through the underbrush, and
continue to utter their mournful "Kuk-kuk-kuk," many times repeated.</p>

<p>This is the only member of this
family of beautiful birds which
reaches our borders. This species
is 12 inches in length, and is a
metallic green color on the upper
parts and breast, and with coppery
reflections of the middle tail feathers,
the outer ones being white,
very finely vermiculated with black,
as are the wing coverts. The underparts,
except for a white band
across the breast, are rosy red. This species nest in
cavities in large trees, generally in large, deserted Woodpecker
holes. They are also said to have been found nesting
in holes in banks. Their eggs are three or four in
number and are a dull white in color. Size 1.10 &times; .85.</p>

<p>Belted Kingfisher.</p></div>

<p>390. <span class="sc">Belted Kingfisher.</span> <i>Ceryle alcyon.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Whole of North America, breeding
from southern United States, northward and
wintering from the southern parts of its breeding
range, southward.</p>

<p>This well known bird is abundant in all localities
near water, where its rattling notes are
among the most familiar of sounds.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/249b.png">
<p>White.</p></div>


<p>Their food
is almost entirely of small fish, which they
catch by plunging upon from their perch on an
old dead limb overhanging
the water,
or by hovering in
the air like an Osprey.
Their nests
are located at the
end of burrows in
sand banks or the
banks of creeks and
rivers. These tunnels,
which are dug
by the birds, generally
commence two or three feet from the top
of the bank and extend back from six to eight
feet, either in a straight line or curved; the end is enlarged to form a suitable
nesting place, in which from five to eight eggs are laid. They are glossy and
pure white in color. Size 1.35 &times; 1.05. Data.--Lake Quinsigamond, Massachusetts,
June 6, 1900. 7 eggs at the end of a 6 foot tunnel in a sand bank. Bird
removed by hand from the nest. Collector, C. E. Howe.</p>

<p>390.1. <span class="sc">Ringed Kingfisher.</span> <i>Ceryle torquata.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Mexico, north casually to the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.</p>

<p>This handsome species is much larger than the Belted Kingfisher and the
underparts are nearly all bright chestnut, except the white throat. They nest in
river banks the same as the common American species, and the eggs are white,
but larger. Size 1.45 &times; 1.10.</p>

<p>Texas Kingfisher.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Southern Texas, south through Mexico.</p>

<p>This variety is much smaller than the Belted,
length 8 inches, and is a lustrous greenish
above, variously speckled with white, and is
white below, spotted with greenish. It is a
common and resident species in southern
Texas, where it lays its eggs in holes in the

glossy, and measure .95 &times; .70.</p>

<h2>WOODPECKERS. Order XV. PICI.</h2>

<h3>Family PICIDAE</h3>

<p>Woodpeckers are well known birds having
sharp chisel-like bills, sharply pointed and
stiffened tail feathers, and strongly clawed feet
with two toes forward and two back, except in
one genus. Their food is insects and grubs,
which they get by boring in trees, and from under the bark, clinging to the
sides of trunks or the under side of branches with their strong curved nails,
aided by the tail, for a prop. They are largely resident where found.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/251b.png">
<p>Ivory-billed Woodpecker.</p></div>

<p>392. <span class="sc">Ivory-billed Woodpecker.</span> <i>Campephilus principalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Locally distributed, and rare, in
Florida, along the Gulf coast and north casually
to South Carolina and Arkansas.</p>

<p>This is the largest of the Woodpeckers found
within our borders, being 20 inches in length.
But one other American species exceeds it in
size, the Imperial Woodpecker of Mexico, which
reaches a length of nearly two feet; as this
species is found within a few miles of our
Mexican border, it may yet be classed as a
North American bird. The present species has
a large, heavy, ivory-white bill. They can
readily be identified, at a great distance, from
the Pileated Woodpecker by the large amount
of white on the secondaries. They used to be
not uncommonly seen in many sections of the
southeast but are now found very locally and
only in the largest and remote woods. They
nest in holes in large trees in the most impenetrable
swamps; laying three, and probably as
many as six pure white glossy eggs measuring 1.45 &times; 1.00.</p>

<p>Range.--United States east of the Plains and
from North Carolina to Canada.</p>

<p>The Hairy Woodpecker or its sub-species is
found in all parts of North America. The nesting
habits and eggs of all the sub-species are
not in any way different from those of the
eastern bird, consequently what is said in regard
to the eastern form will apply equally to

<p>White.</p></div>

<p>Except during the winter
months, this species
is not as commonly seen
about houses or orchards
as the Downy Woodpecker.
During the summer they
retire to the larger woods
to nest, laying their eggs
in holes in the trunks or
limbs of trees at any height from the ground,
and generally using the same hole year after
year, and often twice or three times during
one season, if the first sets are taken. They
lay from three to six glossy white eggs; size .95 &times; .70. This species can
be distinguished
from the Downy Woodpeckers by their larger size (9 inches long),
and the white outer tail feathers, which are unspotted.</p>

<p>This black and white species may be known from any other because of
the uniform black crown and nape, the male having a small dot of red on
either side of the crown, back of the eye. They are quite abundant in the
Gulf States and Florida, where they nest during April and May, and in some
localities in March. They build in hollow trees or stumps at an elevation
from the ground, laying from three to six glossy white eggs; size .95 &times; .70.</p>

<p>401b. <span class="sc">Alpine Three-toed Woodpecker.</span> <i>Picoides americanus dorsalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Rocky Mountains from British Columbia
south to New Mexico.</p>

<p>Slightly larger than the preceding and with
more white on the back, almost entirely losing
the barred effect of the American Three-toed
variety. They nest chiefly in dead pines, laying
four or five white eggs that cannot be distinguished
from those of many other species.
Size .95 &times; .70.</p>

<p>402. <span class="sc">Yellow-bellied Sapsucker.</span> <i>Sphyrapicus varius varius.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America, east of the Plains; breeding from Massachusetts
northward, and wintering from the Carolinas and Illinois southward.</p>

<p>White.</p></div>

<p>This species is one of the most handsomely marked of the family; they can
easily be recognized by the red crown and throat (white on the female), each
bordered by black, and the yellowish underparts. The members
of this genus have been found to be the only ones that
are really injurious, and these only to a slight extent, to cultivated
trees. This species and the two following are the only
real "sapsuckers," a crime that is often attributed to the most
useful of the family. Their nesting season is during May and
June, they then resorting to the interior of the woods, where
they deposit their four to seven glossy eggs on the bottom
of holes in trees, generally at quite an elevation from the
ground. Size of eggs .85 &times; .60.</p>

<p>402a. <span class="sc">Red-naped Sapsucker.</span> <i>Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Rocky Mountain region of the United States and southern Canada
south to Mexico and west to California.</p>

<p>This variety differs from the last, chiefly in addition of a band of scarlet
on the nape in place of the white on the Yellow-bellied species. Coming as
it does, midway between the ranges of the preceding species and the following,
this variety, with its extension of red on the head and throat, may be regarded
somewhat as a connecting link between the two species, but it is perfectly distinct
and does not intergrade with either. There appears to be no difference in
the nesting habits of the two varieties, except that the present one, according to
Bendire, shows a preference to nesting in live aspens. The eggs measure
.90 &times; .65.</p>

<p>403. <span class="sc">Red-breasted Sapsucker.</span> <i>Sphyrapicus ruber ruber.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific Coast from Lower California
to Oregon.</p>

<p>Except for a whitish line from the eye to
the bill, the entire head, neck and breast of
this species is red, of varying shades in different
individuals, from carmine to nearly a scarlet;
the remainder of their plumage is very
similar to that of the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker.
This is an abundant species and in most parts
of the range they are not timid. Like many of
the Woodpeckers, they spend a great deal of
their time in drumming on some dead limb.
They nest commonly in aspens, preferably living
ones, and are said to build a new nesting
hole each year rather than use the old. The
eggs are laid during May or June, being glossy
white, five to seven in number, and measuring
.90 &times; .70.</p>

<p>404. <span class="sc">Williamson's Sapsucker.</span> <i>Sphyrapicus thyroideus.</i></p>

<p>This is a deeper and brighter variety, and is more yellowish on the belly. Its
nesting habits and eggs are the same as those of the southern form.</p>

<p>Range.--Mountain ranges from the Rockies to the Pacific; north to British
Columbia.</p>

<p>This oddly marked species shows a surprising number of variations in plumage;
the normal adult male is largely black on the upper parts and breast,
with only a narrow patch of red on the throat, and with the belly, bright yellow.
The female is entirely different in plumage and for a long time was supposed to
be a distinct species; she is brownish in place of the black in the male, has no
red in the plumage, and is barred with black and white on the back and wings.
They nest at high altitudes in mountain ranges, either in coniferous forests or
in aspens. There is no peculiarity in their nesting habits; they lay from four
to seven eggs, glossy white. Size .97 &times; .67.</p>

<p>405. <span class="sc">Pileated Woodpecker.</span> <i>Phl&oelig;otomus pileatus pileatus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Southern and South Atlantic States.</p>

<p>This heavily built Woodpecker is nearly as large as the Ivory-bill, being 17
inches in length. They are not nearly as beautiful as the Ivory-bills, their
plumage being a sooty black instead of glossy, and the white on the wing,
being confined to a very small patch at the base of the primaries; the whole
crown and crest are vermillion, as is also a moustache mark in the male. They
breed in the most heavily timbered districts, and generally at a high elevation;
excavating a cavity sometimes 25 inches in depth and eight inches in diameter.
In most localities they are very shy and difficult to approach. During April or
May they lay from three to six white eggs. Size 1.30 &times; 1.00.</p>

<p>This variety is only very slightly larger

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/258b.png">
<p>White.</p></div>

<p>This beautiful species
has a bright red head,
neck and breast, glossy
blue black back, wings
and tail, and white underparts,
rump and secondaries.
It is the most abundant
of the family in the
greater portion of its
range, where it nests in
any kind of trees or in telegraph poles at any
height from the ground; they also sometimes
nest in holes under the eaves of buildings. They
are the most pugnacious of the Woodpeckers,
and are often seen chasing one another or driving
away some other bird.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/258c.png">
<p>Red-headed Woodpecker.</p></div>

<p>They are also known
to destroy the nests and eggs of many species,
and also to kill and devour the young, they
being the only Woodpecker, so far as known,
to have acquired this disreputable habit; they
also feed upon, besides ants and larv&aelig;, many
kinds of fruit and berries. Their nesting season
is during May and June, when they lay
from four to eight white eggs, with less gloss
than those of the Flicker. Size 1.00 &times; .75.</p>

<p>This species may be identified by the black
region around the base of the bill, the white
forehead, red crown and nape, yellowish throat,
and blackish upper parts, extending in a band
across the breast, this variety having the band
streaked with white posteriorly. The habits of
this variety are the same as the next which is
most abundant in the United States.</p>

<p>This bird differs from the last in having fewer
white stripes in the black breast band. In
suitable localities, this is the most abundant of
Woodpeckers on the Pacific coast. They have
none of the bad habits of the Red-heads, appear
to be sociable among their kind, and are not

where they nest in any place that attracts their fancy; in some localities they
also commonly nest in telegraph poles. They are quite tame, and during the
winter months come about yards and houses, the same as, and often in company
with Downy Woodpeckers. Their eggs, which are laid during May, are glossy
white, average in size 1.00 &times; .75 and number from four to six.</p>

to be the most universal. They have the undulating
flight common to all Woodpeckers and
show the white rump patch conspicuously when
flying. They are often found on the ground in
pastures or on side hills, feeding upon ants;
they are more terrestrial than any others of
the family. They nest anywhere, where they
can find or make a suitable cavity for the reception
of their eggs; in trees in woods or solitary
trees in large pastures, in apple trees in
orchards, in fence posts, in holes under the
roofs of buildings, etc. They ordinarily lay
from five to ten very glossy eggs, but it has
been found that they will continue laying, if
one egg is removed from the nest at a time,
until in one case seventy-one eggs were secured.
Fresh eggs may be found at any time from
May until August, as they frequently raise two
broods a season. Size of eggs, 1.10 &times; .90 with

they are silent and hiding in the woods during
the day time, they are not as popularly known
as are most birds. They rarely fly during the
day time unless disturbed from their roosting
place which is on the ground under underbrush
or in hollow logs. Their notes, which are a rapid and repeatedly uttered whistling
repetition of their name, are heard until late in the night. They nest during
April, May or June, laying two eggs on the ground amid the leaves in woods
or scrubby underbrush. The eggs are grayish to creamy white in color, handsomely
marked with shades of lilac, gray and brownish; size 1.40 &times; 1.00.</p>

<p>417. <span class="sc">Whip-poor-will.</span> <i>Antrostomus vociferus vociferus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America east of the Plains; north to the southern parts of the
British possessions; winters along the Gulf coast and southward.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/265c.png">
<p>Whip-poor-will.</p></div>

<p>This species is well known, by sound, in nearly all parts of its range, but
comparatively few ever observed the bird, and probably the greater number
mistake the Nighthawk for this species. The two species can readily be distinguished
at a distance by the absence of any pronounced white marking in
the wings, and by the white tips to the outer
tail feathers in the present species, while the
Night Hawk has a prominent white band across
the tail, but the top is black, and the tail slightly
forked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px"><img alt="" src="images/265d.png">
<p>Creamy white.</p></div>

<p>The Whip-poor-will, rarely leaves
its place of concealment before dark, and is
never seen flying about cities, as are the Nighthawks.
In their pursuit
of insects, they glide
like a shadow over
fields and woods, their
soft plumage giving
forth no sound as their
wings cleave the air.
Until late at night, their
whistling cry "whip-poor-will,"
repeated at
intervals, rings out in all wooded hilly districts.
Their two eggs are deposited on the
ground among dead leaves, generally in dense
woods. They are grayish white or cream color
marbled with pale brown and gray, with fainter
markings of lilac. Size 1.50 &times; .85.</p>

white band across the primaries,
the latter mark showing
very plainly during flight. Besides
in the country, they are
very common in cities, where they will be seen any summer day towards dusk
flying, skimming, sailing, and swooping over the tops of the buildings, upon
the gravel roofs on which they often lay their eggs. They nest generally on
rocky hillsides or in open woods, laying their two eggs upon the top of a flat

<p>This well known species is sooty brownish
black, 5.5 inches long, and has the tail feathers
terminating in sharp spines. They are very
abundant in all portions of their range, and
may be seen on the wing at all hours of the
day, but especially abundant in the early morning
and toward dusk. They formerly dwelt
and bred only in hollow trees, and a great many
still continue to do so, as large hollow stumps
are known where hundreds nest every year.
The majority of the eastern Chimney Swifts
now nest in old chimneys that are unused, at
least during the summer; some small chimneys
contain but a single pair while other large ones
may have from fifty to a hundred or more nests
glued to the sides. The birds are on the wing
during the greater part of the day, generally
not frequenting the vicinity of their nesting
site, but returning toward dusk, when they may
be seen to, one at a time, dive headforemost into
the tops of chimneys. </p>

<h2>HUMMINGBIRDS. Family TROCHILIDAE</h2>

<p>Hummingbirds have been truly called "Winged Gems." They are the smallest
of birds, the usual plumage being a metallic green with throat or crown
patches of the brightest of iridescent shining red, orange, blue or
violet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/273a.png">
<p>427--429.</p></div>

<p>Their nests are marvels of architecture being compactly and intricately made of plant
fibres and downy feathers ornamented in some cases with lichens. Their flight
is accompanied by a peculiar buzzing sound produced by their rapidly vibrating
stiffened wing feathers. Their food is small
insects and honey both of which they get chiefly
from flowers.</p>

<p>426. <span class="sc">Rivoli's Hummingbird.</span> <i>Eugenes fulgens.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Mexico, north in summer to southern
Arizona where they breed at high elevations
in the Huachuca Mountains.</p>

<p>This is one of the most gorgeous of the Hummers
having the crown a violet purple color,
and the throat brilliant green. This species
saddles its nest upon branches often at heights
of 20 or 30 feet from the ground. They are
made of plant down and generally decorated
with lichens on the outside, similar to nests of
the Ruby-throat. The two white eggs measure
.65 &times; .40.</p>

<p>427. <span class="sc">Blue-throated Hummingbird.</span> <i>Cyanol&aelig;mus clemenci&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Mexico, north in summer to the
border of Arizona and western New Mexico.</p>

<p>This species is the largest of North American
Hummers being 5.25 inches long, this being
slightly larger than the preceding. As the
name implies, it has a patch of blue on the
throat, the upper parts being a uniform greenish;
the outer tail feathers are broadly tipped
with white. Their nests, which are placed upon
the limbs of trees, are made of mosses and
plant fibres covered with cobwebs. The two
eggs are laid during July and August, and
measure .65 &times; .40.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px"><img alt="" src="images/275b.png">
</div>

<p>Similar in size and appearance to the Ruby-throat, but with the chin and
upper throat black, the
rest of the throat gorget
being violet or amethyst.
It is an abundant species
in summer in many localities,
especially in the southern
half of its range. They
build their nests at low elevations,
rarely above ten
feet, on small branches or
the fork at the end of a
limb. The nests are made
of yellowish plant fibres
and are not covered with
lichens, so that they have
a peculiar spongy appearance.
Eggs indistinguishable
from those of the
Ruby-throat. Laid during
April, May or June.</p>

<p>Buffy gray.</p></div>

<p>This peculiar species is grayish above and lighter gray below, has dark slaty
crown, and a patch of rose color on the lower throat. This
is the only representative of this tropical family that has
been found as yet over the Mexican border, but its near
ally, the Rose-throated Becard has been found within a
very few miles and will doubtless be added to our fauna
as an accidental visitor ere long. Their nests are large
masses of grasses, weeds, strips of bark, etc., partially
suspended from the forks of branches. Their eggs number
four or five and are a pale buffy gray color, dotted and scratched with a pale
reddish brown and dark gray. Size .95 &times; .70. The one figured is from a set
in the collection of Mr. Crandall, taken June 1, 1897 at Presidio Sinaloa, Mexico.</p>

<h2>FLYCATCHERS. Family TYRANNID&AElig;</h2>

<p>Flycatchers, which are found only in America and chiefly in the tropics, are
insect-eating birds, generally having a grayish colored plumage, sometimes
adorned with a slight crest or a coronal mark of orange, red, or yellow. Only
two of the species found in North America are gaudy in plumage, the Vermilion,
and the Derby Flycatchers. They all have the habit of sitting erect on a
dead twig, and watching for passing insects, which they catch on the wing.</p>

<p>The Scissor-tail or "Texan Bird of Paradise"
is the most beautiful member of this interesting
family. Including its long tail, often 10
inches in length and forked for about 6 inches,
this Flycatcher reaches a
length of about 15 inches.
It is pale grayish above,
fading into whitish below,
and has scarlet linings to
the wings, and a scarlet
crown patch. They are
one of the most abundant
of the breeding birds in
Texas, placing their large
roughly built nests in all kinds of trees and at
any elevation, but averaging between ten and
fifteen feet above ground. The nests are built
of rootlets, grasses, weeds and trash of all
kinds, such as paper, rags, string, etc. The
interior is generally lined with plant fibres,
hair or wool. They lay from three to five, and rarely six eggs with a creamy
white ground color, more or less spotted and blotched with reddish brown, lilac
and gray, the markings generally being most numerous about the larger end.
They average in size about .90 &times; .67. Data.--Corpus Christi, Texas, May 18,
1899. 6 eggs. Nest of moss, vines, etc., on small trees in open woods near town.

They are one of the most pugnacious and courageous
of birds attacking and driving away any
feathered creature to which they take a dislike,
regardless of size.
Before and during the
nesting season, their
sharp, nerve-racking clatter
is kept up all day long,
and with redoubled vigor
when anyone approaches
their nesting site. They
nest in any kind of a tree,
in fields or open woods, and at any height
from the ground, being found on fence rails
within two feet of the ground or in the tops of
pines 70 or 80 feet above the earth. Nearly
every orchard will be found to contain one or more pairs of these great insect</p>

made of plant fibres, weeds, string, paper or
any trash that may be handy, being sometimes
quite bulky. Their eggs do not differ in any
particular from those of the eastern bird, except
that they may average a little smaller.

head, is separated from the crown by a white forehead
and line over the eye; the throat is white
shading into yellow on the underparts. They are
abundant in the interior of Mexico, but can hardly
be classed as common over our border, where they
nest in limited numbers. Their nests are unlike
those of any of our other Flycatchers being large
masses of moss, weeds and grass, arched over on

<p>This peculiar Flycatcher,
which is unlike any other
American species, can only
be regarded as a rare breeding
bird in the Huachuca Mts.
It is 8 inches in length, has
a grayish back streaked with
black, the tail largely rusty
brown and the underparts sulphur
yellow, streaked on the
breast and sides with dusky;
a yellow crown patch is bordered
on either side by a stripe
of mottled dusky, and is separated
from the blackish
patch through the eye, by
white superciliary lines. Their
habits are similar to those of the genus Myiarchus, and, like them, they nest in
cavities in trees, and lay from three to five eggs of a creamy buff color thickly
spotted and blotched with brown and purplish, the markings not assuming the
scratchy appearance of the Crested Flycatchers, but looking more like those of
a Cardinal; size of egg 1.05 &times; .75. Data.--Huachuca Mts., Arizona, June 29, 1901.
4 eggs. Nest in the natural cavity of a live sycamore tree about fifty feet from
the ground; composed of twigs. Collector, O. W. Howard.</p>

<p>This trim and graceful, but quarrelsome, species is grayish
on the head, neck, and breast, shading to greenish on
the back and quite abruptly into bright yellow on the
underparts; the head is slightly crested and the inner webs
of all the lateral tail feathers are reddish brown. They
are abundant in most of their range but are generally shy
so they are not as often seen as many other more rare
birds. They nest in cavities of any kind of trees and at
any elevation from the ground, the nest being made of
twigs, weeds and trash, and generally having incorporated
into its make-up a piece of cast off snake skin. They lay from four to six
eggs of a buffy color, blotched and lined with dark brown and lavender.

<p>White.</p></div>

<p>These very common, grayish colored birds are very often known as "Bridge
Birds" because of the frequency with which they construct their nests under
bridges and arches; they also build in crevices in ledges or
among the hanging roots near the tops of embankments, and on
the rafters or beams of old buildings. The nests are made of
mud, moss and grass, lined with feathers. The four or five eggs
measure .75 &times; .55. Occasionally, eggs will be found that have
a few minute spots of reddish brown. Freak situations in which
to locate their nests are often chosen by these birds, such as
the brake beam of a freight car, in the crevices of old wells, hen
houses, etc. The birds are one of the most useful that we have; being very
active and continually on the alert for insects and beetles that constitute their
whole bill of fare.</p>

higher, making a very deeply cupped interior. The outside
of the nest is made of fibres, cobwebs, catkins, etc., firmly
felted together and ornamented with green lichens to match
the limb upon which it is saddled. The interior is heavily
lined with dried, yellowish grasses, making a very strong contrast
to the exterior. They are fairly abundant birds in the

June. They lay three eggs of a rich creamy color, spotted and blotched, chiefly
about the larger end, with reddish brown and lilac gray. Size .95 x .61. Data.--Huachuca

<p>462a. <span class="sc">Large-billed Wood Pewee.</span> <i>Myiochanes richardsoni peninsul&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>Range.--This species which differs from the
last only slightly, as is indicated by the name,
inhabits the peninsula of Lower California; its
nesting habits and eggs will not differ from those of the other Pewees.</p>

<p>463. <span class="sc">Yellow-bellied Flycatcher.</span> <i>Empidonax flaviventris.</i></p>

south of the United States.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/295b.png">
<p>Creamy white.</p></div>

<p>This species is slightly larger than the Least Flycatcher and is
more yellowish above and below, the breast being quite bright.
While common in some districts it is quite shy and frequents
thickly wooded regions, where it is not very often seen. They
nest near or on the ground among rocks or roots of fallen trees,
chiefly in swampy places; the nests are made in bunches of
moss, hollowed out and lined with very fine grasses. Their four
eggs are creamy or buffy white, spotted and speckled about the larger end with
reddish brown and gray; size .68 &times; .51.</p>

<p>464. <span class="sc">Western Flycatcher.</span> <i>Empidonax difficilis difficilis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Western North America, from the Rocky Mountain region to the
Pacific, and north to Alaska; winters chiefly south of the United States.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/295c.png">

<p>This Flycatcher, which is similar to the last, nests in similar
locations as well as in many others, such as crevices and fissures
in rocks, holes in banks, cavities in trees, rafters in buildings,
etc. The nests are variously made, but consist chiefly of fine
grasses, weeds and fibres. The eggs are as a rule similar to
those of the last species and cannot be distinguished.</p>

are quite common. They
build semi-pensile nests in
the forks of bushes or overhanging
branches at heights
of from four to twenty feet, the nests being
made of rootlets, fibres, fine grasses, etc., and
partially suspended from the branch; they are
quite shallow and loosely constructed and often
appear more like a bunch of debris deposited in

<p>This species is very similar to the next, but the back is said
to be more brownish. They are common and nest abundantly
in thickets and low scrubby woods, usually placing the nest
at a low elevation, preferably in a clump of willows; the nests
are made of fine strips of bark, plant fibres, and very fine rootlets
being woven about and firmly fastened in upright
crotches. Their eggs, which are laid in June, are buffy white,

buff below. It is not a common species anywhere,
but is known to nest during June or
July, on high mountain ranges, saddling its

<p>This is one of the most gaudy attired of all North American birds, being
brownish gray on the back, wings and tail, and having a bright vermillion crown,
crest and underparts. They are quite common in southern Texas, but far more
abundant in the southern parts of Arizona. Their habits do not
differ from those of other Flycatchers, they living almost exclusively
upon insects. The majority of their nests can not be distinguished
from those of the Wood Pewee, being covered with
lichens and saddled upon limbs in a similar manner, but some
lack the mossy ornamentation. Their three or four eggs are
buffy, boldly blotched with dark brown and lavender, chiefly in a wreath about

<p>This noted foreigner has been imported and
liberated a number of times in this country, but
apparently is not able to
thrive here, a fact which will
not cause much regret when
we remember the experiment
with the English Sparrow.
They are abundant in Europe
and Great Britain where they
nest on the ground in cultivated
fields or meadows, laying from three to
five grayish eggs, marked with brown, drab and
lavender.</p>

<p>474. <span class="sc">Horned Lark.</span> <i>Otocoris alpestris alpestris.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Eastern North America, breeding in
Labrador and about Hudson Bay; winters in
eastern United States south to Carolina.</p>

<p>This variety of this much sub-divided species is 7.5 inches in length, has
brownish gray upper parts and is white below with black patches on the breast
and below the eye, yellowish throat and small black ear tufts. The various subspecies
are all marked alike, their distinction being based upon slight differences
in size, variations in the shade of the back, or the greater or less intensity
of the yellowish throat and superciliary stripe. The nesting habits of all the
varieties are the same and the eggs differ only in the shade of the ground color,
this variation among the eggs of the same variety being so great that an egg
cannot be identified without knowing the locality in which it was taken. The
present variety build their nests on the ground generally under tufts of grass
or in hollows in the moss which is found in their breeding range, making them
of dried grasses and generally lining them with feathers. The eggs are grayish
with a slight greenish tinge, and are specked and spotted over the whole surface
with drab, brownish and dark lavender. The eggs of this and the next
variety average considerably larger than those of the more southerly distributed
varieties; size .92 &times; .65.</p>

<p>These beautiful and
bold marauders are too
well known to need description,
suffice it to
say that they are the
most beautiful of North
American Jays; but beneath
their handsome
plumage beats a heart
as cruel and cunning as
that in any bird of prey. In the fall, winter
and spring, their food consists largely of
acorns, chestnuts, berries, seeds, grain, insects,
lizards, etc., but during the summer months
they destroy and devour a great many eggs and
young of the smaller birds, their taste for
which, being so great that they are known to
watch a nest until the full complement of eggs
is laid before making their theft. They nest
in open woods or clumps of trees, indifferently, in pines or young trees, building
most often below twenty feet from the ground; the nests are made of twigs
and rootlets, lined with fine rootlets. During May they lay from four to six
eggs of a greenish buff color spotted with olive brown. Size 1.10 x .80.</p>

<p>477a. <span class="sc">Florida Blue Jay.</span> <i>Cyanocitta cristata florincola.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Florida and the Gulf coast.</p>

<p>The nesting habits and eggs of this smaller sub-species are the same as those
of the northern Blue Jay. Like our birds, they frequently nest near habitations.</p>

<p>478. <span class="sc">Steller's Jay.</span> <i>Cyanocitta stelleri stelleri.</i></p>

throughout its range.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px"><img alt="" src="images/305c.png">
<p>Greenish blue.</p></div>

<p>All the members of this sub-species are similar in
plumage, having a sooty black head, crest and neck,
shading insensibly into dark bluish on the back and
underparts, and brighter blue on the wings and tail.
They usually have a few streaks or spots of pale blue on
the forehead. They are just as noisy, bold and thievish
as the eastern Jay and are also excellent mimics like
the latter. They nest in fir trees at any height from the
ground and in April or May deposit their three to six
greenish blue eggs which are spotted with various
shades of brown. Size 1.25 x .90. Their nests are more
bulky than those of the eastern Jay and are usually made of larger sticks and
held together with some mud.</p>


<p>478a. <span class="sc">Blue-fronted Jay.</span> <i>Cyanocitta stelleri frontalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Coast ranges of California and Oregon.</p>

<p>This is the bird that is well known to hunters of "big game" by various
names such as "Whiskey Jack", "Moose Bird", "Camp Robber", etc. During
the winter months, owing to the scarcity of food, their thieving
propensities are greatly enhanced and they
remove everything from the camps, which looks
as though it might be edible. Birds of this
genus are smoky gray
on the back and lighter
below, shading to white
on the throat; the forehead
and part of the
crown is white and the
nape blackish. Their
nests are placed at low
elevations in bushes or
fir trees, and are usually
very different from any of the preceding Jays'
nests. They are nearly as high as wide, and
are made of small twigs, moss, catkins, weeds
and feathers making a soft spongy mass which
is placed in an upright crotch. The eggs are
a yellowish gray color spotted and blotched with
brown and grayish. Size 1.15 &times; .80. Data.--Innisfail,
Alberta, March 12, 1903. Nest a beautiful
structure of twigs, moss and feathers in a
willow bush, 6 feet from the ground. The thermometer
registered 32 below zero the day the

<p>The Raven is like a very large Crow,
length 24 inches, but has the feathers
on the neck lengthened and stiffened.
Their habits are similar to those of the

remain mated for life. Besides grasshoppers
and worms, they feed largely
upon animal matter such as lizards,
shell fish, frogs, eggs and young of
birds, and carrion. They nest on
ledges of high inaccessible cliffs or
the tops of tall trees, making large
nests of sticks lined with smaller ones
and hair or wool; the eggs are laid in
April or May, number from four to
seven, and are light greenish in color,
blotched with umber and drab. Size 1.95 &times; 1.25.</p>

matter, the same as the large Ravens, and
they are not nearly as shy, frequently feeding
in camps upon refuse which is thrown
out to them. They build at low elevations
in any tree, but preferably in mesquites,
making their nests of sticks and lining them
with hair, leaves, bark, wool or anything
soft. During June they lay from four to six
pale bluish green eggs, generally sparingly spotted or scratched with dark

<p>These birds, against which the hand of every
farmer is uplifted, are very shy and cunning;
as is well known, they nearly always post a
sentinel in some tree top to keep watch while
the rest of the flock is feeding in the field below.
In the fall and winter, large numbers of them flock, and at night all roost
in one piece of woods; some of the "crow roosts" are of vast extent and
contain thousands of individuals.</p>

<p>Crows nest
near the tops of large trees, preferably pines,
either in woods or single trees in fields. Their
nests are made of sticks and lined with rootlets,
and the eggs, which are laid in April or May,
range from four to seven in number, are a bluish
or greenish white, sparingly or very densely
speckled, spotted and blotched with various shades
of brown and lilac. Size 1.60 &times; 1.15.</p>

<p>This small Crow which is but 16 inches in length, is found only on the coast,
where they feed upon shell fish and offal. They nest, as do the Ravens, either
on ledges or in tree tops. The eggs resemble those of the common Crow, but
are smaller. Size 1.55 &times; 1.05.</p>

<p>From Virginia southward, this small Crow
(length 16 inches) is more abundant on the coast
than the common Crow which is often in company
with this species. Their food consists of grain,
berries, and animal matter. Their nesting habits
are like those of the common Crow and the eggs
are similar and have as great variations, but are

<p>The Clarke Crow, as this bird is often known,
is a common resident in most of its range. The
adults are grayish with black wings and central
tail feathers, the tips of the primaries and
outer tail feathers being
white. Their tail is short
and their flight slow and
somewhat undulating like
that of some of the Woodpeckers.
Their food consists
of anything edible
from seeds and larv&aelig; in
the winter to insects, berries,
eggs and young birds
at other seasons. In the spring they retire to
the tops of ranges, nearly to the limit of trees,
where they build their large nests of sticks,
twigs, weeds, strips of bark, and fibres matted
together so as to form a soft round ball with a
deeply cupped interior; the nest is located at
from ten to forty feet from the ground in pine trees and the eggs are laid early
before the snow begins to leave. They are three in number, grayish in color
with a greenish tinge and finely spotted over the whole surface with dark
brown and lavender. Size 1.30 &times; .90. Data.--Salt Lake Co., Utah, April 25,
1900. Nest placed in pine 40 feet up on a horizontal branch, and not visible
from below. The tree was at the upper edge of a pine forest at an altitude of
about 3000 feet above Salt Lake City. The nest was discovered by seeing the
parent fly into the tree; the next day a nest was found with three young nearly
ready to fly. Collector, W. H. Parker. This set of three eggs is in the oological
collection of Mr. C. W. Crandall.</p>

<p>This Crow-like Jay has a nearly uniform bluish plumage,
and is found abundantly in the pine belts of its
range. Their habits are similar to those of the Clarke

slowly in all directions.</p>

<p>They build their nests
in all sorts of locations
such as are used by the

<p>This black and white bird is well known in the east, where his sweet, wild
music, often uttered on the wing, is much admired.
He sings all day long during May and
June to his Sparrow-like mate, who is sitting
on her nest concealed in the
meadow grass. They are
quite sociable birds and several
pairs often nest in the
same field, generally a damp
meadow; the nests are hollows
in the ground, lined with
grass and frequently with the top slightly arched
to conceal the eggs, which are grayish white,
clouded, spotted and blotched with brownish,

<p>This variety is like the last, but slightly
smaller. The nesting habits of the two are
identical and the eggs are indistinguishable.
It is believed that Cowbirds do more damage to
the smaller birds than all other dangers combined,
as their young being larger and stronger
either crowd or smother the other young or else starve them by getting most
of the food brought to the nest.</p>

<p>These birds are familiar
to every frequenter of the
country, in their range;
too familiar to many, for
the enormous flocks do
considerable damage to
grain fields in the fall.
They also do a great
amount of good at other
seasons in the destruction of injurious insects
and weed seed. They breed from April in the
southern parts of their range to May and June
in the northern, making their nests of grasses,
woven and twisted together and placing them
in bushes in swamps or over water, and sometimes
on the ground in clumps of grass. Their
eggs are from three to five in number, bluish
white boldly spotted, clouded or lined with blackish brown and purplish. Size
1.00 &times; .70. The nests and eggs of the numerous sub-species are all precisely the
same as those of this bird, so we will but enumerate the varieties and their
range. To identify these varieties other than by their ranges will require
micrometer calipers and the services of the men who separated them.</p>

Their nests are swung
from the under side of
leaves of the yucca palm
or from small branches of
low trees, and are made of grass and fibres.
The eggs are bluish white, specked and blotched
chiefly about the large end with blackish
brown and lilac gray. Size .95 X .65. Data.--Chiricahua

<p>This species is orange yellow except for the face, throat,
fore back, wings and tail, which are black; the wings are
crossed by two white bars. These handsome birds are the
most abundant of the Orioles on the Lower Rio Grande,
where their pure mellow whistle is heard at frequent intervals
throughout the day. They generally build their nests
in hanging moss from mesquite trees, turning up at the
ends and lining the pocket with moss, or else make a
shallow hanging nest of fibres and suspend it from yuccas.
During May or June they lay from three to five eggs of a white color, spotted
(rarely lined) with purplish brown and gray. Size .85 &times; .60.</p>

<p>505a. <span class="sc">Arizona Hooded Oriole.</span> <i>Icterus cucullatus nelsoni.</i></p>

<p>This variety is like the last but more yellowish. Their nests are made of a
wiry grass compactly woven together and partially suspended to mistletoe twigs
growing from cottonwood trees; nests of this type are perfectly distinct from
those of the preceding, but when they are made of fibre and attached to yuccas,
they cannot be distinguished from nests of the former variety. Their eggs are
similar to those of the Hooded Oriole, but generally more strongly marked and
usually with some zigzag lines. Size .85 &times; .60.</p>

<p>This beautiful and well known eastern Oriole
can readily be identified by its orange flame
color and entirely black head. Even better
known than the birds, are the pensile nests
which retain their positions on the swaying
drooping branches all
through the winter. Although
they build in
many other trees, elms
seem to be their favorites.
Their nests are
made of plant fibres and
frequently string, and
often reach a length of
about 10 inches and
about half that in diameter; they are usually
attached to drooping branches by the rim so
that they rock to and fro, but are sometimes
held more firmly in position by having their
side bound to a branch. Their eggs, which are
laid in May and June, are white, streaked and
lined with blackish brown and grayish. Size

twigs and grass, lined with fine green grass; this structure
is situated in bushes or low trees in swampy places and at
from 3 to 20 feet from the ground. The eggs are laid in

<p>The birds are very curious
both in appearance and
actions, being very "flighty"
and restless, and apt to remain
to breed on any of the
mountains. They build during
March or April, making
their nests of twigs, rootlets,
moss, feathers, etc., and placing them in forks
or on branches of trees (usually conifers) at
any height from the ground. The eggs are
greenish white, spotted with brown and with
lavender shell markings; size .75 &times; .55.</p>

<p>521a. <span class="sc">Mexican Crossbill.</span> <i>Loxia curvirostra stricklandi.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Northern North America, breeding in the Alleghanies
and from northern Maine northward; winters to
middle portions of the United States.</p>

<p>This species is rosy red with two white wing bars. Like
the last, they are of a roving disposition and are apt to
be found in any unexpected locality. Their nesting habits
are the same as those of the American Crossbill, but the
eggs average larger and the
markings are more blotchy; size .80 &times; .55.</p>

<p>This is the largest of the genus, and can
be distinguished from the others by its very
dark chestnut coloration and the gray hindneck
and cheeks. Like the other
Leucostictes, they are
found in flocks and frequent
rocky or mountainous
country, where they
are nearly always found
on the ground. They build
in crevices among the
rocks or under ledges or
embankments, making the
nest of weeds and grasses. Their four or five
pure white eggs are laid during June. Size

They are resident
throughout their United States
range, where they breed in
August or early in September,
being one of the latest nesting birds that
we have. Their nests are located in bushes, at
a height of generally below fifteen feet above
the ground, being placed in upright forks, and
made of plant fibres and thistle down, firmly
woven together. They lay from three to six

<p>A streaked grayish, buffy

by its chestnut shoulders and
white outer tail feathers.
They are abundant birds in
eastern fields where their
loud piping whistle is known
to many frequenters of weedy
pastures. They build on the ground, either
in grassy or cultivated fields, lining the hollow
scantily with grasses. Their four or five eggs
are usually laid in May or June; they are dull
whitish, blotched and splashed with light
brown and lavender tints; size .80 &times; .60.</p>

<p>These birds, which were imported from
Europe, have increased so rapidly that they
have overrun the cities and villages of the country
and are doing inestimable damage both by
driving out native insect
eating birds and by their
own destructiveness. They
nest in all sorts of places
but preferably behind
blinds, where their unsightly
masses of straw
protrude from between the
slats, and their droppings besmirch the buildings
below; they breed at all seasons of the
year, eggs having often been found in January,
with several feet of snow on the ground and
the mercury below zero. The eggs number from
four to eight in a set and from four to eight
sets a season; the eggs are whitish, spotted
and blotched with shades of gray and black.

<p>To my mind this is the

with its bright and softly
blended plumage and the pure
white throat boldly contrasting
with its grayish breast
and sides of the head; the
lores are adorned with a
bright yellow spot. They are one of the most
abundant of Sparrows in the east during migrations
and their musical piping whistle is
heard from hedge and wood. They nest most
abundantly north of our borders, laying their
three or four eggs in grass lined hollows in
the ground, or more rarely in nests in bushes.

<p>As indicated by their name <i>socialis</i>, Chipping Sparrows
are sociable birds not only with others of the bird tribe, but
with man. In all localities that are not overrun with English
Sparrows, you will find these confiding birds nesting in
trees and shrubs in the yard and in vines from porches,
while in orchards, nearly every tree has its
tenant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/348b.png">
<p>Bluish white.</p></div>

<p>They are smaller birds than the
last (5.5 in. long) and have the brown
crown bordered by blackish and a black
line through the eye. Their nests, which
may be found at any height from the
ground and in any kind of a tree or shrub,
are made of fine grass and weed stems, lined
with hair; their three to five eggs are a handsome
greenish blue, sparingly specked chiefly about the large
end with blackish brown and purplish. Size .70 &times; .52.</p>

<p>560a. <span class="sc">Western Chipping Sparrow.</span> <i>Spizella passerina arizon&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>This variety is much duller colored than the last and
has but little brown on the back; its nesting habits are the same and the eggs
do not appear to differ in any respect from those of the eastern bird.</p>

<p>561. <span class="sc">Clay-colored Sparrow.</span> <i>Spizella pallida.</i></p>

<p>These birds can best be described as like
the Chipping Sparrow with the brown largely
replaced with blackish. They breed quite
abundantly in Manitoba and Minnesota, placing
their nests on or near the ground, and
making them of fine grasses. The eggs cannot
be distinguished with certainty from
those of the preceding but average a trifle
smaller. Size .65 &times; .50. Data.--Barnsley, Manitoba, May
24, 1900. Nest of grass stalks lined with fine grass, one

nest commonly in dry arid regions, placing
their nests at low elevations in
bushes or cacti, preferably young mesquites,
and making them of coarse grass
lined with finer. Two broods are raised
a season and from May to August sets

<p>A favorite and one of the
most abundant in all sections
of the east. They are sweet
and persistent songsters and
frequent side hills, pastures,
roadsides, gardens and dooryards
if English Sparrows be
not present. They nest indifferently
upon the ground or in bushes, generally
artfully concealing the nest by drooping
leaves; it is made of grass and weed stems,
lined with fine grass or, occasionally, horse
hair. As is usual in the case of birds that
abound about habitations they frequently
choose odd nesting sites. They lay two and
sometimes three sets of eggs a season, from May to August, the eggs being
three to five in number and white or greenish white, marked, spotted, blotched
or splashed in endless variety of pattern and intensity, with many shades of
brown; some eggs are very heavily blotched so as to wholly obscure the ground
color while others are specked very sparingly. They measure .80 &times; .60 with
great variations.</p>

<p>586. <span class="sc">Texas Sparrow.</span> <i>Arremonops rufivirgatus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Eastern Mexico and southern Texas.</p>

<p>This odd species has a brownish crown, olive greenish upperparts, wings and
tail, and grayish white underparts. They are common resident
birds along the Lower Rio Grande, being found in tangled
thickets, where they nest at low elevations, making their
quite bulky nests of coarse weeds and grass and sometimes
twigs, lined with finer grass and hair; they are often partially
domed with an entrance on the side. Their eggs are plain
white, without markings; often several broods are raised in a
season and eggs may be found from May until August.</p>

<p>Towhee or Chewink.</p></div>

<p>587. <span class="sc">Towhee.</span> <i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America east of the Plains,
breeding from the Gulf to Manitoba.</p>

<p>The well known Towhee, Ground Robin or
Chewink is a bird commonly met with in eastern
United States; it frequents thickets,
swamps and open woods where they nest generally
upon the ground and sometimes in
bushes near the ground.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/360b.png">
<p>Purplish white.</p></div>

<p>The nests are well
made of grasses, lined with
fine grasses and rootlets,
and the eggs, which are laid
in May or June, are pinkish
white, generally finely
sprinkled but sometimes
with bold markings of light
reddish brown, with great
variations. Size .90 &times; .70.</p>


<p>Towhees are noisy birds and at frequent intervals,
while they are scratching among the
leaves for their food they will stop and utter their familiar "tow-hee" or "che-wink"
and then again will mount to the summit of a tree or bush and sing their
sweet refrain for a long time.</p>

<p>587a. <span class="sc">White-eyed Towhee.</span> <i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus alleni.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Florida and the Atlantic coast to South Carolina.</p>

<p>This variety is like the preceding except that the eyes are white instead of
red. There is no difference between their nesting habits and eggs, except that
they much more frequently, and in some localities, almost always, nest in trees.</p>

<p>588. <span class="sc">Arctic Towhee.</span> <i>Pipilo maculatus arcticus.</i></p>


<p>Range.--Great Plains, breeding from northern United States to the Saskatchewan.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/360c.png">
<p>Pinkish white.</p></div>

<p>This species is similar to the eastern Towhee but has the scapulars and
coverts tipped with white. They nest abundantly in suitable
localities in Montana and North Dakota and more commonly
north of our borders. Like the eastern Towhee, they
nest on the ground under the protection of overhanging
bushes, the nests being made of strips of bark and grasses
and lined with fine rootlets. Their three or four eggs, which
are laid during May, June or July, are pinkish white, profusely
speckled with reddish brown; very similar to those
of the eastern Towhee. Size .92 &times; .70.</p>

<p>588a. <span class="sc">Spurred Towhee.</span> <i>Pipilo maculatus montanus.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Breeds from Mexico to British Columbia, west of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Similar to the last but with less white on the back. The nesting habits and
eggs are like those of the Towhee, but in some localities the nests are most
often found in bushes above the ground.</p>

<p>All Shrikes are similar in nature and plumage, being
grayish above and white below, with black wings, tail and ear patches, and
with white outer tail feathers and bases of primaries; the present species may
be known by its larger size (length over 10 inches) and wavy dusky lines on the
breast. They are bold and cruel birds, feeding upon insects,
small rodents and small birds, in the capture of
which they display great cunning and courage; as they
have weak feet, in order to tear their prey to pieces with
their hooked bill, they impale it upon thorns. They nest
in thickets and tangled underbrush, making their nests of
vines, grasses, catkins, etc., matted together into a rude
structure. During April or May they lay from four to
six grayish white eggs, spotted and blotched
with yellowish brown and umber; size 1.05

<p>This is the most common of the Vireos in
the greater part of its range and is a most persistent
songster, frequenting groves, open
woods or roadsides. Their eyes are brown,
scarcely if any more red than those of any
other species and I have yet
to see one with red eyes outside
of mounted museum specimens.
They swing their
nests from the forks of trees
at any elevation from the
ground but usually below ten
feet, and I have found them
where the bottom rested on the ground; they
are made of strips of bark, fibre, etc., and often
have pieces of string or paper woven into the
sides; they are one of the most beautiful of
bird homes and are woven so strongly that old
nests hang to the branches for several seasons.
Their three or four eggs, often accompanied by
one of the Cowbirds, are laid in May or June; they are white, sparingly specked
with blackish brown. Size .85 &times; .55.</p>

<p>625. <span class="sc">Yellow-green Vireo.</span> <i>Vireosylva flavoviridis.</i></p>

usually placed higher in the trees. The birds
are even more persistent singers, than are the
latter but the song is more musical and delivered
in a more even manner,
as they creep about
among the foliage, peering
under every leaf for lurking
insects. The eggs are pure
white, spotted with brown or

<p>Warblers as a family may be classed as the most beautiful, interesting and
useful birds that we have. With few exceptions, they only return from their
winter quarters as the trees shoot forth their leaves or flowers, they feed largely
among the foliage upon small, and mostly injurious, insects. They are very
active and always flitting from branch to branch, showing their handsome
plumage to the best advantage. Their songs are simple but effectively delivered
and the nests are of a high order of architecture.</p>

<p>This species has greenish upper
parts, white lower parts and superciliary
line, and gray crown and
nape. They nest either on the
ground or at low elevations in
bushes, making the structure of
grasses and fibres, lined with hair;
they are found on wild, tangled hillsides and
mountain ranges. The eggs are pure white, sparingly
specked with reddish brown. Size .62 &times; .45.</p>

<p>648. <span class="sc">Parula Warbler.</span> <i>Compsothlypis americana americana.</i></p>

<p>The upper parts of this handsome species are
bluish gray with a greenish patch in the middle
of the back; the throat and breast are yellow
with a patch of black and chestnut.
They are
abundant birds in suitable localities, breeding in
swamps, especially those with old or dead trees
covered with hanging moss (usnea).</p><br>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/392c.png">

<p>The nests may be found
at any height from the ground, and are usually made by turning
and gathering up the ends of the hanging moss to form a
pocket, which is lined with fine grass or hair. The four to six
eggs are white or creamy white, wreathed with specks of reddish
brown and chestnut. Size .64 &times; .44.</p>

<p>The nesting habits of the northern form of the Blue-yellow-backed Warbler
are in all respects like those of the last, and like them, where moss grown
swamps are not to be found, they have been known to construct nests of moss
suspended from branches of trees, or to nest in bunches of dead leaves. Data.--Oxford,
Mass., June 7, 1895. Nest in a dead pine swamp; made in end of hanging
moss about 6 feet from the ground. Large colony breeding.</p>

<p>This species is, without exception, the most exquisite
of the family; the male can always be
known by the bright orange throat, breast and
superciliary stripe, the upper parts being largely
black. They arrive with us when the apple trees
are in bloom and after a week's delay pass on to
more northerly districts. Their nests are constructed of rootlets,
fine weed stalks and grasses, lined with hair, and are placed on
horizontal limbs of coniferous trees. The three or four eggs are
greenish white, speckled, spotted and blotched with reddish
brown and neutral tints. Size .70 &times; .48. Data.--Lancaster, Mass.,
June 21, 1901. Nest in a white pine, 38 feet from the ground on
a limb 4 feet from the trunk; composed of fine rootlets and hair,
resembling the nest of a Chipping Sparrow.</p>

pines. The nests are usually placed
out among the pine needles where they are very
difficult to locate, and resemble nests of the Chipping
Sparrow. I have found them at heights ranging
from six to forty or fifty feet from the ground.

chiefly on the higher ranges. Winters
south to Central America.</p>

<p>This peculiar species has the entire head
bright yellow and the throat black; upperparts
grayish, underparts white. They are found nesting
in wild rugged country, high up in pine trees,
the nests being located among bunches of needles
so that they are very difficult to find. The nests
are made of rootlets, shreds of bark, pine needles,
etc., lined with fine grasses or hair. The three or
four eggs are laid during June or the latter part
of May; they are white or creamy white, and
sometimes with a faint greenish tinge, specked
and wreathed with brown and lilac gray. Size

Bahamas where by far the greater number of
specimens have been found.</p>

<p>This very rare Warbler is bluish gray above,
streaked with black, and yellow below with the
throat and sides streaked. Until the summer of
1903, the locality where they bred was a mystery.
The capture of a specimen, in June, in Oscodo Co.,
Michigan, led to the search for the nests by N.
A. Wood, taxidermist for the Michigan Museum
at Ann Arbor. He was successful in his quest
and found two nests with young and one egg. The
nest in which the egg was found contained two
young birds also. It was in a depression in the
ground at the foot of a Jack pine tree and only a few feet from a cart road.
The nest was made of strips of bark and vegetable fibres, lined with grass and
pine needles. The egg is white, sprinkled with brown in a wreath about the
large end. Size .72 &times; .56. It is estimated that there were thirteen pairs of the
birds in this colony.</p>

be located by their peculiar, musical
lisping trill. They nest high in these trees,
placing their nests in thick bunches of needles,
so that they are very difficult to locate. They

have a peculiar habit of "teetering" their tail
which will readily identify them. They nest on the ground in, or on the edges
of swampy places, lining the hollow with grasses and rootlets. In May or June

<p>Crown and ear coverts black, underparts
and line over eye yellow;
no white in the plumage. These
birds are found in about such localities
as are frequented by Oven-birds,
but with a preference for
woods which are low and damp.
They are locally common in some of the southern
and central states. They are active gleaners of
the underbrush, keeping well within the depths
of tangled thickets. Like the Maryland Yellow-throat,
which has similar habits to those of this
bird, they are quite inquisitive and frequently
come close to you to investigate or to scold. They
nest on the ground in open woods or on shrubby
hillsides, making large structures, of leaves and
strips of bark, lined with grasses. The eggs are
white, sprinkled with dots or spots of reddish
brown and gray. Size .70 &times; .55. Data.--Greene
Co., Pa., May 26, 1894. 4 eggs. Nest a mass of
leaves, lined with rootlets, placed on the ground
at the base of a small elm sprout in underbrush
on a hillside.</p>

<p>678. <span class="sc">Connecticut Warbler.</span>--<i>Oporonis agilis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Eastern United States; known to breed
only in Manitoba and Ontario.</p>

<p>These birds have greenish upperparts and
sides, yellowish underparts, and an ashy gray
head, neck and breast; they have a complete whitish
ring about the eye, this distinguishing them
in any plumage from the two following species.
As they do most of their feeding upon the ground
and remain in the depths of the thickets, they are rarely seen unless attention
is drawn to them. They are quite abundant in New England in fall migrations,
being found in swampy thickets. They have been found breeding in Ontario
by Wm. L. Kells, the nest being on the ground in the woods among raspberry
vines. It was made of leaves, bark fibres, grass, rootlets and hair. The eggs
are white, specked with brown and neutral tints. Size .75 &times; .55.</p>

recently been still further sub-divided so that this

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/414b.png">
<p>White.</p></div>

<p>The Maryland Yellow-throat is represented in
all parts of the United States by one of its forms.
They are ground loving birds, frequenting swamps
and thickets where they can be
located by their loud, unmistakable
song of "Witchery, w i t c h e r y,
witch." They nest on or very near
the ground, making their nests of
grass, lined with hair; these are
either in hollows in the ground at
the foot of clumps of grass or
weeds, or attached to the weed stalks within a
few inches of the ground. They lay from three
to five eggs in May or June; these are white,
specked about the larger end with reddish brown
and umber, and with shell markings of stone gray.
Size .70 &times; .50. All the sub-species of this bird
have the same general habits of this one and their
eggs cannot be distinguished from examples of
the eastern form; the birds, too, owing to the
great differences in plumage between individuals
from the same place, cannot be distinguished with
any degree of satisfaction except by the ones who
"discovered" them.</p>

<p>681a. <span class="sc">Western Yellow-throat.</span> <i>Geothlypis trichas occidentalis.</i></p>

<p>This peculiar species is like the common Yellow-throat
but has the black mask bordered by
yellow instead of white, and the black on the
forehead extends diagonally across the head from
in front of one eye to the rear of the other. Their
habits are like those of the other Yellow-throats
and the nests are similar to those of the latter,
which are frequently placed in cane over the
water. Nests found by Mr. Walter E. Bryant
were situated in clumps of "cat-tails" between
two and three feet above the water; the nests
were made of dry strips of these leaves, lined
with fibres; the eggs were like those of the common
Yellow-throats but larger; size .75 &times; .56.</p>

<p>This strange but handsome species is very common
in underbrush and thickets in the south; they are
usually shy and endeavor, with success, to keep out of
sight, but their strange song and calls, consisting of
various whistles and squawks mingled together, are often
heard. Their nests are built in bushes or briars at low
elevations, being made of grass, strips of bark and leaves,
lined with finer grass; their eggs are white, sharply
speckled and spotted with various shades of brown and

<p>These short-tailed, grayish colored birds are among the strangest of feathered
creatures; they frequent the sides of mountain streams where they feed upon
aquatic insects and small fish. Although they do not have webbed feet, they
swim on or under water with the greatest of ease and rapidity, using their
wings as paddles. They have a thrush-like bill and the teetering habits of the
Sandpiper, and they are said to be one of the sweetest of songsters. They nest
among the rocks along the banks of swiftly flowing streams, and sometimes
beneath falls; the nests are large round structures of green moss, lined with
fine grass and with the entrance on the side. The eggs are pure white, four or

all over except the large sharply defined white
throat patch; the underparts, wings and tail
are barred with black, and the back is specked
with white. Their name is well chosen for
they are found abundantly in rocky canyons,
ravines, and side hills. They nest in crevices
or caves among the rocks, placing their nests
in small niches; they are made of twigs, leaves,
grasses and feathers, and the three to six eggs,
which are laid from April to June according to
locality, are white, sprinkled and blotched with
reddish brown and lilac. Size .72 &times; .52.</p>

<p>These loud-voiced songsters are well known in the south
where they are very abundant, being found along banks of
streams, in thickets, along walls, or about brush heaps. They
nest in almost any suitable nook or corner, in hollow trees
or stumps, bird boxes, about buildings, and in brush or
bushes. When in exposed positions, the nest, which is
made of all sorts of trash, is arched over; the eggs, which
are laid from March to June, and frequently later, as several
broods are sometimes reared in a season, are white,
profusely specked with light reddish brown and purplish.
Size .74 &times; .60.</p>

<p>These are the smallest of the Wrens, being but four inches in
length; they have a very short tail which, like those of the
others, is carried erect over the back during excitement or
anger. They are very sly birds and creep about through stone
walls and under brush like so many mice; they have a sweet
song but not as loud as that of the House Wren. Their nests
are placed in crevices of stumps, walls, old buildings or in brush
heaps, being made of twigs and leaves, lined with feathers. Their eggs, which
are laid during May or June, are pure white, finely and sparingly dotted with
reddish brown; size .60 &times; .48.</p>

up the tree trunks, searching the
crannies of the bark for larvae.
They make their nests behind
loose hanging bark on old tree

building them of twigs, bark,
moss, etc., held together with
cobwebs. The eggs, which are laid in May
or June, are pure white, specked and spotted
with reddish brown; they average in size .58

<p>This species breeds in the extreme northern parts of Asia, and
I believe its eggs have never been found on this continent. They
build their nests of moss and grasses, on the ground in open
woods, concealing them under tufts of grass or tussocks of earth.
The three to five eggs are white, spotted with pale reddish brown.
Size .70 &times; .50.</p>

<p>748. <span class="sc">Golden-crowned Kinglet.</span> <i>Regulus satrapa satrapa.</i></p>

<p>Range.--North America, breeding from northern United States northward,

winters throughout the United States.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/441d.png">
<p>Gray.</p></div>

<p>This rugged little fellow appears to be perfectly content in our
northern states even during the most severe winters and leaves
us early in the spring for his breeding grounds farther north.
They are usually found in company with Chickadees and, like
them, may be seen hanging to twigs in all sorts of positions as
they search for their meagre fare. Their nests are large, round
structures of green moss, bark strips and fine rootlets, very
thickly lined with soft feathers; these are placed in forks or partially suspended
among the branches of spruce trees, usually high above the ground. During
June they lay from five to ten eggs of a dull whitish or grayish color, spotted
heavily with pale brown and lilac. Size .55 &times; .42.</p>

<p>This unique species is of a uniform brownish gray color, with a white eye
ring, narrow bar on wing, and outer tail feathers, and
with the bases of the primaries rusty colored. It is a
ground inhabiting bird, feeding upon insects and berries
in shrubbery and thickets. Their song is said to be liquid,
melodious and often long continued, equaling that of any
other bird. They nest on the ground in hollows under
banks or crevices about roots of trees or fallen stumps,
making a large, loosely constructed pile of weeds and
trash, hollowed and lined with rootlets. The three or

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/450b.png">
<p>Greenish blue.</p></div>

<p>These handsome birds breed abundantly in
Alaska and locally in mountain ranges south
to northern California. They nest at low elevations
in trees, making
them of moss, twigs,
weeds and grasses,
forming a flat shallow
structure. Their eggs
are greenish blue sharply
but sparingly spotted
with dark brown; size
1.12 &times; .80. Data.--Delta
of Kowak River, Alaska, June 11, 1899. Four
eggs. Nest 12 feet from the ground, against
the trunk of a slender spruce and supported
by a clump of stiff twigs.</p>

<p>763a. <span class="sc">Northern Varied Thrush.</span> <i>Ixoreus n&aelig;vius meruloides.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Interior of western North America, breeding from British Columbia
to Alaska. Its habits and eggs do not differ from those of the last.</p>

<p>764. <span class="sc">Siberian Red-spotted Bluethroat.</span> <i>Cyanosylvia suecica robusta.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Northern Asia; casually to Alaska.</p>

<p>This beautiful foreigner nests on the ground and lays four to six greenish blue
eggs, spotted with reddish brown; size .75 &times; .50.</p>

<p>765. <span class="sc">Wheatear.</span> <i>Saxicola &oelig;nanthe &oelig;nanthe.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Asia; casual in Alaska in summer; nesting habits and eggs like the

<p>Pale greenish blue.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Europe and Greenland; casual on the Atlantic coast
of North America.</p>

<p>This very abundant Old World species is a common breeding
bird in Greenland and probably also in Labrador. They
nest in crevices of quarries, holes in the ground, or stone
walls, making a rude nest of weeds, moss or grasses, lined
with hair or feathers, and during May lay from four to six
pale greenish blue eggs; size .90 &times; .60.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px"><img alt="" src="images/452a.png">
<p>Bluebird.</p></div>

<p>Range.--Eastern United States, breeding from the Gulf to southern Canada.
Winters in the southern half of the United States.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px"><img alt="" src="images/452b.png">

<p>These familiar birds build in cavities in trees,
usually below 20 feet from the ground, crevices
among ledges, bird boxes and in any suitable
nook they may discover about buildings,
providing that English Sparrows do not molest
them. They raise several
broods a year, commencing in
April when they lay from
three to six pale bluish white
eggs (rarely pure white);
size .80 &times; .60. The cavities
of their nesting sites are lined
with grasses and feathers
usually, although I have found the eggs on
the unlined bottom of cavities in trees.</p>

<p>766a. <span class="sc">Azure Bluebird.</span> <i>Sialia sialis fulva.</i></p>

<p>Range.--This pale variety is found in southern
Arizona and southward.</p>

<p>Its nesting habits are the same and the eggs
are indistinguishable from the last.</p>

<p>[Illustration: ]</p>

<p>767. <span class="sc">Western Bluebird.</span> <i>Sialia mexicana occidentalis.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Pacific coast from Lower California to British Columbia.</p>

<p>The Western Bluebird is as common and familiar in its range as the common
Bluebird is in the east. It nests in similar locations and its eggs are scarcely
distinguishable, although averaging a trifle darker in shade; size .80 &times; .60.</p>

<p>767a. <span class="sc">Chestnut-backed Bluebird.</span> <i>Sialia mexicana bairdi.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Rocky Mountain region from Mexico to Wyoming.</p>

<p>The nesting habits or eggs of this brighter colored bird do not differ from
those of the last species.</p>

<p>767b. <span class="sc">San Pedro Bluebird.</span> <i>Sialia mexicana anabel&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>Range.--San Pedro Martir Mountains in Lower California.</p>

<p>The eggs of this variety will not in all probability be any different from those
of the preceding Bluebirds.</p>

<p>768. <span class="sc">Mountain Bluebird.</span> <i>Sialia currucoides.</i></p>

<p>Range.--Rocky Mountain region, breeding from New Mexico north to Great
Slave Lake; winters in southwestern United States and Mexico.</p>

<p>This azure blue species is common in the greater part of its range and is found
west to the Sierra Nevadas in California. Like the eastern Bluebird they nest
in holes in trees or anywhere that they can find a suitable cavity or crevice.
Their eggs are slightly larger than those of the other Bluebirds and have a
slight greenish tint; size .85 &times; .64.</p>

<h1>Birds of Eastern North America</h1>

<h4>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</h4>

<p>The Bird Book of the year. It is authentic. The author KNOWS birds.
He has studied them for thirty years--in the hand, for plumage, and in their
haunts, for habits. He has studied them in their homes and has photographed
hundreds as they were actually feeding their young. Besides being able to
write about these things in an interesting and instructive manner, he is classed
as one of the foremost bird artists in America. This rare combination of
Artist-Author-Naturalist
has produced, in "Birds of Eastern North America," the
ultimate bird book.</p>

<p>The technical descriptions aided by the pictures give perfect ideas of the
plumage of adults and young.</p>

<p>The descriptive text gives the important and characteristic features in the
lives of the various species.</p>

<p>The illustrations--well, there are 408 PICTURES IN NATURAL COLORS;
they show practically every species, including male, female, and young when
the plumages differ, and they are perfectly made by the best process.</p>

<p>Bound in cloth, handsomely illuminated in gold; 464 pages (4&frac12; &times; 6&frac12;); 408
colored illustrations; every bird described and pictured.</p>

<p class="mid">$3.00 postpaid</p>

<h1>Color Key To N. A. Birds</h1>

<h4>By F. M. CHAPMAN and C. A. REED</h4>

<p>This might well be called an illustrated dictionary of North American birds,
the male of each species being shown in COLOR from pen and ink drawings.
Uniform with Egg Book. 350 pages.</p>

<h1>LAND BIRDS</h1>

<h4>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</h4>

<h1>THE TREE GUIDE</h1>

<h4>By JULIA ELLEN ROGERS</h4>

<p class="mid">Author of "The Tree Book"</p>

<p>The Tree Guide is uniform in style and size with the well known pocket
Bird Guides which have become so universally popular. It contains illustrations
(32 of them colored and many in black and white) and descriptions of
every tree east of the Rocky Mountains. The descriptions include the range,
the classification, the distinctive features such as flowers, leaves, fruit, etc.,
and all other marks that lead to an easy identification of the tree. No detail
that will help the student has been omitted and the small size of the volume,
about the length and width of the hand, makes it convenient to carry. An
ideal volume for expert naturalist or amateur for field work or even more
exhaustive study.</p>

<h2>Nature Studies--In Field and Wood</h2>

<h4>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</h4>

<p>This book is destined to be one of the most important that the author has
written. Absorbingly interesting in itself, yet its greatest value will lie in
the fact that it will lead the reader to realize how blind he has been to the
many wonderful things that are happening on every hand.</p>

<p>The brook, the pond, the field, the woods, the swamps and even the back
yards yield quantities of very interesting subjects for study. This book treats
entertainingly of many of these interesting creatures, but its chief aim is to be
an "awakener"--to arouse within the reader the desire to go out and verify
some of the facts given, or to do some original investigation himself. Such
studies develop the senses of perception and observation immensely, and the
one who is "alive" to what is going on about him surely is better able to cope
with all situations in life than one who sees nothing until it is forcibly brought
to his attention.</p>

<p>112 pages; size--5&frac12; &times; 7&frac12; in. 40 illustrations in color, and black and white.</p>

<h2>Camera Studies of Wild Birds in Their Homes</h2>

<h4>By CHESTER A. REED, B. S.</h4>

<p>"CAMERA STUDIES" affords everyone an opportunity for a very intimate
study of bird life. A good photograph of an event together with an interesting
description of it is the next best thing to witnessing the event itself.</p>

<p>"CAMERA STUDIES" has 250 photographs of events right in birds' home.
These pictures are selected from the author's collection of over 2000 bird photographs,
this being one of the best collections of pictures of free, living wild
birds in existence.</p>

<p>Many rare and interesting poses are faithfully shown by the camera. For
instance, a pair of adult Chipping Sparrows, standing on a branch by the sides
of their four young, are engaged in pulling apart a large worm that was too
large to be given whole.</p>

<p>The stories accompanying these pictures are as interesting as the photographs
and above all they are all actual facts.</p>

<p>300 pages, 5&frac12; &times; 7&frac12; in.; 250 photographs of living, wild birds.</p>

clear image of an object is desired.</p>

<p>We carefully examined more than a hundred makes of field glasses, to select
the ones best adapted for bird study.</p>

<p>We found one make that was superior to any other of the same price and
equal optically, and nearly as well made as those costing three times as much.</p>

<p>They magnify about three diameters, and have an unusually large field of
vision or angle of view, making it easy to find a bird or keep him in sight.
